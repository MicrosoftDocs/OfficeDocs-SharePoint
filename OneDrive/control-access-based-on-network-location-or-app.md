# Control access based on network location or app

To prevent users and guests from accessing OneDrive and SharePoint content on devices outside of specific domains, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185071" target="_blank">Access control page in the SharePoint admin center</a> and select **Network location**. For more info, see [Control access to SharePoint and OneDrive data based on network location](/sharepoint/control-access-based-on-network-location). You can also use the Access control page to control access from unmanaged devices.
