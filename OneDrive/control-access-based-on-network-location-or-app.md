# Control access based on network location or app

To prevent users and guests from accessing OneDrive and SharePoint content on devices outside of specific domains, go to the [Access control page in the SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=accessControl&modern=true) and select **Network location**. For more info, see [Control access to SharePoint and OneDrive data based on network location](/sharepoint/control-access-based-on-network-location). You can also use the Access control page to control access from unmanaged devices.
