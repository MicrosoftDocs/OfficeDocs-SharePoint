# Control access to features in the OneDrive and SharePoint mobile apps

If your organization has **Microsoft Intune** or **Enterprise Mobility + Security**, you might have created a [global policy](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy#app-protection-global-policy) in the OneDrive admin center to control your organization's data in the OneDrive and SharePoint mobile apps. 
  
The policy settings in the OneDrive admin center are no longer being updated. Instead of setting up this policy, we recommend using the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) to create and assign app protection policies. [Learn how](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policies)
  
For the full list of the policy settings for iOS/iPadOS and Android, see:

- [iOS/iPadOS policies](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios)
- [Android policies](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android)
