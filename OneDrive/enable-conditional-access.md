# Enable conditional access support in the OneDrive sync client for Windows

Conditional access control capabilities in Azure Active Directory offer simple ways for you to secure resources in the cloud. The new OneDrive sync client works with the conditional access control policies to ensure syncing is only done with compliant devices. For example, you might require sync to be available only on domain-joined devices or devices that meet compliance as defined by the Mobile Device Management system (like Intune).
  
For information about how conditional access works, see:
  
- [Azure Active Directory conditional access](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823173)
    
- [How to set Azure Active Directory device-based conditional access policy for access control to Azure Active Directory connected applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-policy-connected-applications)

## Getting started

Use the following steps on each computer.
  
 **To enable conditional access support on the OneDrive sync client**
  
1. [Download and install](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844652) the OneDrive sync client. 
    
2. Download and open [EnableCAPreview.reg](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=824970) to enable the conditional access feature. 
    
3. Restart the sync client.
    
If you want to disable this feature, you can delete the registry key by running [DisableCAPreview.reg](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828724). You need to restart the sync client for the change to take effect.
  
## Known issues

The following are known issues with this release:
  
- If you create a new access policy after the device has authenticated, it may take up to twenty-four hours for the policy to take effect.
    
- Conditional access for macOS is in preview.
    
- In some cases, the user may be prompted for credentials twice. We are working on a fix for this issue.
    
- Certain ADFS configurations may require additional setup to work with this release. Please run the following command on your ADFS server to ensure FormsAuthentication is added to the list of PrimaryIntranetAuthenticationProvider:
    
     `Set-AdfsGlobalAuthenticationPolicy -PrimaryIntranetAuthenticationProvider @('WindowsAuthentication', 'FormsAuthentication')`
    
- If you enable location-based conditional access, users will get a prompt about every 90 to 120 minutes by default when they leave the set of approved IP address ranges. The exact timing depends on the access token expiry duration (60 minutes by default), when their computer last obtained a new access token, and any specific conditional access timeouts put in place.
    
## Reporting problems

Please let us know if you run into any problems while using this release.
