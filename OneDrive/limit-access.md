# Limit OneDrive access by security group

Use this setting if you want to allow only users in specified security groups to access OneDrive. Even if other users outside of these security groups are licensed for OneDrive, they wonâ€™t have access to their own OneDrive or any shared OneDrive content.

To access and use this feature, your organization must have one of the following subscriptions: 

- Office 365 E5/A5 
- Microsoft 365 E5/A5 
- Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance/A5 Compliance 

## Enablement

To enable this feature:

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185071" target="_blank">Access control in the SharePoint admin center</a>, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

2. Select **Limit OneDrive access**.

3. Select **Limit OneDrive access to only users in specified security groups**.
