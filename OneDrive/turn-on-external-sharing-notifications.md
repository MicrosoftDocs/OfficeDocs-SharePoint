# Control notifications

By default, users receive notifications about file activity in OneDrive and SharePoint. These notifications appear across apps and devices. For example, the service sends notifications through the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to the Office mobile app for Android or the Apple Push Notification service to the Office mobile app for iOS. It also sends notifications to the OneDrive sync app for Windows or Mac. As a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, you can turn off these notifications for all users for compliance purposes. If you allow these notifications, users can select to turn them off app by app where they don't want them.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the service sends notifications to users when files are shared with them. Later, it will send notifications when people @mention the user in a comment. Other notifications might be added in the future. <br> Notifications aren't available for the US government environments or Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China).
  
## Allow or block notifications

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185072" target="_blank">**Settings** in the new SharePoint admin center</a>, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.
    
2. Select the **Notifications** setting for OneDrive.
  
3. Select or clear **Allow notifications**.
  
You can also control this setting in PowerShell by using [Set-SPOTenant -NotificationsInOneDriveForBusinessEnabled](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant).

The Notifications page of the OneDrive admin center included three other settings under "Email OneDrive owners when":

- Other users invite more external users to shared files. You can control this by using [Set-SPOTenant -NotifyOwnersWhenItemsReshared](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant). 
- External users accept invitations to access files. (This setting no longer works for the new sharing experience that appears in most places.)
- An anonymous access link is created or changed. You can control this by using [Set-SPOTenant -OwnerAnonymousNotification](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant).
