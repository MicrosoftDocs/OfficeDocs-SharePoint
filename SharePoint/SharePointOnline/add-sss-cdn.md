# Add the SharePoint Success Site playlist to your M365 Learning Pathways solution

If you already have [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/) solution provisioned, you can add the SharePoint Success Site Content Pack to M365 learning pathways without [provisioning the SharePoint Success Site template](./provision-sss.md). In the learning pathways administration page, you can add a reference to the SharePoint Success Site CDN (Content Delivery Network), so the SharePoint Success Site content can be delivered through the Learning Pathways Web part.

The SharePoint Success Site's up-to-date CDN includes a range of content that helps new users and existing site owners plan, build, and manage SharePoint sites:

- **Plan your site:** Guidance on how to plan a site, including what type of SharePoint site to use, access rights, and permission strategy
- **Create your site:** Content that helps new site owners create their site, including how to brand and customize their site and how to add content
- **Share and manage your site:** Guidance to help launch, share, and manage the new site
- **Advanced site creation:** Content for site owners that want to learn beyond site creation basics

## Add the SharePoint Success Site CDN

1. From the Learning Pathways SharePoint site, select **Home** and then **Learning pathways Administration**
2. Select the ellipsis (...) and then **Add Content Pack**
