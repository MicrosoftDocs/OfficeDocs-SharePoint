## Management and governance

**[Data access governance reports](data-access-governance-reports.md)** - These reports help you discover sites that contain potentially overshared or sensitive content. You can use these reports to assess and apply appropriate security and compliance policies.

**[Limit OneDrive access by security group](limit-access.md)** - You can limit OneDrive access to members of a specific security group if you want to allow only certain users to have access. Even if other users outside of these security groups are licensed for OneDrive, they won't have access to their own OneDrive or any shared OneDrive content.

**[Review recent SharePoint site actions](recent-actions-panel.md)** - You can review and export the most recent site-related actions you made in the SharePoint admin center in the last 30 days by using the recent actions panel. Site property changes like site name, site creation and deletion, site URL, sharing settings, and storage quota are listed as actions in the panel. Note that changes made to organization-level settings, and changes made by other admins are not shown in the panel.

## Secure collaboration

**[Manage site access based on sensitivity label](authentication-context-example.md)** - With Azure Active Directory authentication context, you can enforce more stringent access conditions when users access SharePoint sites. Authentication contexts can be directly applied to sites or used with sensitivity labels to connect Azure AD conditional access policies to labeled sites.

**[Configure a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint document library](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-default-label)** - When SharePoint is enabled for sensitivity labels, you can configure a default label for document libraries. Then, any new files uploaded to that library, or existing files edited in the library will have that label applied if they don't already have a sensitivity label, or they have a sensitivity label but with lower priority.

**[Restricted Access Control for SharePoint sites](restricted-access-control.md)** - You can restrict the access of a SharePoint site and its content only to the members of Microsoft 365 group connected to the site. Users who are not in the Microsoft 365 group won't have access even if they previously had site access permissions to a file.

**[Block the download of files from a SharePoint site or OneDrive](block-download-from-sites.md)** - You can block download of files from SharePoint sites or OneDrive without needing to use Azure Active Directory conditional access policies. Users have browser-only access with no ability to download, print, or sync files. They also won't be able to access content through apps, including the Microsoft Office desktop apps.
