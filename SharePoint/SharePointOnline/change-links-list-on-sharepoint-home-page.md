# Add featured links to the SharePoint start page

As a Global Administrator or SharePoint Administrator in Microsoft 365, you can feature the sites and content you want on the SharePoint start page by changing the **Featured links** list in the left pane. To add links to a SharePoint Server page, see [Video: Add a link to a page](https://support.office.com/article/F9B329F9-67BB-4258-A686-9CD98415E7CA).
  
> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about the SharePoint start page, see [Find news, sites, and portals in Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/6b85097a-87e0-4611-a29a-dfd49b1a1220). 
  
To view the SharePoint start page:
  
1. Sign in with your work or school account at https://www.office.com/signin.
    
2. Select SharePoint from the list of apps. 
    
    ![Microsoft 365 start page with SharePoint selected](media/4ff2c093-2b26-4d28-a65b-4d02e66818df.png)
  
    If you don't see the list of apps, select the app launcher icon ![The app launcher icon in Microsoft 365](media/e5aee650-c566-4100-aaad-4cc2355d909f.png) in the top-left corner of the page, and then select **SharePoint**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you had custom promoted sites in classic view of the SharePoint Sites page, the Featured links section of the SharePoint start page is pre-populated with those sites. The pre-population of promoted sites in the Featured links list happens only once when the first user visits the new SharePoint start page. If you go back to classic view and change the promoted sites, the changes will not be reflected in the Featured links list on the SharePoint start page.
