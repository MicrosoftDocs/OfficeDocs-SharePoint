# Add featured links to the SharePoint start page

 As a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can feature the sites and content you want on the SharePoint start page by changing the **Featured links** list in the left pane. To add links to a SharePoint Server page, see [Video: Add a link to a page](https://support.office.com/article/F9B329F9-67BB-4258-A686-9CD98415E7CA).
  
> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about the SharePoint start page, see [Find news, sites, and portals in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/6b85097a-87e0-4611-a29a-dfd49b1a1220). 
  
To view the SharePoint start page:
  
1. Sign in with your work or school account. For help, see [Where do I sign in?](https://support.office.com/article/17e859dc-88be-45a0-97be-a8837efb2c24.aspx#BKMK_WhereSignIn).
    
2. Select SharePoint from the list of apps.

    If you don't see the list of apps, select the app launcher icon ![The app launcher icon in Office 365](media/e5aee650-c566-4100-aaad-4cc2355d909f.png) in the top left corner of the page, and then select **SharePoint**.

Can't find the app you're looking for? From the app launcher, select **All apps** to see an alphabetical list of the Office 365 apps available to you. From there, you can search for a specific app. 
  
You'll see the **Featured links** list on the left side of the page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you had custom promoted sites in classic view of the SharePoint Sites page, the Featured links section of the SharePoint start page is pre-populated with those sites. The pre-population of promoted sites in the Featured links list happens only once when the first user visits the new SharePoint start page. If you go back to classic view and change the promoted sites, the changes will not be reflected in the Featured links list on the SharePoint start page.
