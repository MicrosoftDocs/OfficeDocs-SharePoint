## Site design is based on a proven change management model

   ![Image of the Workplace transformation site design model](media/hybrid-model.png)

**1. Awareness and commitment –** Start communicating details about upcoming changes with users and provide various support channels and opportunities to engage through events and [Yammer community chats](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-and-create-a-community-in-yammer-56aaf591-1fbc-4160-ba26-0c4723c23fd6).
<br>

**2. Learn –** Build training content right into the site itself by using [Microsoft 365 Learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/).
<br>

**3. Practice and exploration –** Use your organization’s [champion community](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net:443/media/Default/DocResources/Adoption/Build_Champions_Program_Guide.pptx) in leading hand-on events and demonstrations in addition to 1:1 help.
<br>

**4. Use and consult –** Use [Microsoft Lists](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to help your organization manage tasks and knowledge checks associated with training and change management objectives.
<br>

**5. Sustain –** Help users practice and sustain new skillsets and habits by using micro-learning content like quick tips and [publishing regular news posts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7) sharing change management success stories. 



## How to use the Workplace transformation site template
The Workplace transformation site can be used to drive any topic or scope of organizational change. The site template helps organizations to successfully manage the people side of their organization change management to ensure all impacted employees are informed, have support, and know where they can learn more about upcoming changes.

**Examples of the types of change projects that could benefit from the workplace transformation template:**
<br>

- **New process –** Communicate and manage changes to data security policies, new contract management workflows, or project intake processes.

- **Merger and acquisition –** Onboard new employees and help current employees understand what to expect and how to work together.

- **New systems –** Roll out a new employee benefits program, or help employees adopt new tools and apps.


### Pre-populated content focuses on the hybrid workplace
The workplace transformation site features pre-populated content that revolves around helping organizations transition to a hybrid workplace. The hybrid workplace is one that is flexible when and where people do their work. Many organizations plan to allow employees to work from home up to 50% of the time, which means the organization will need to adopt new ways of working to ensure wellbeing and productivity.

<br> 

   ![Image of the Yammer web part](media/hyrbid-yammer.png)

**Yammer -** Connect the [Yammer conversations web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da#conversations) on the **Community** page with an existing Yammer community.

<br>

#### Use M365 Learning pathways to embed training content on a page
If your tenant admin has set up [M365 Learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_plancontent), you can [add pages to the site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec) and use the [Learning pathways web part](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_addwebpart) to display custom training playlists.
<br>

#### Use tools to help target content to specific audiences or protect content from specific audiences
Consider using [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-content-to-a-specific-audience-on-a-sharepoint-site-68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to surface important content to specific groups or use [information barriers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/associate-information-segments-with-sharepoint-sites-2b03db07-6d3f-4297-a388-b943317a26a7#:~:text=%20Associate%20segments%20with%20a%20SharePoint%20site%20,10%20segments,%20and%20then%20select%20Save.%20More) to protect sensitive information that may appear in the **Managers** section under **Resources**. 


#### Update the site theme and branding
Edit the look of your site to align with your organization's brand. Customize the site display name, logo, theme, header layout, navigation style, and more in the [Change the look panel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

#### Customize site navigation
Site navigation is important because it helps users immediately understand what can be accomplished on a given site. The most effective SharePoint sites help viewers find what they need quickly so that they can use the information to make decisions, learn about what is going on, access the tools they need, or engage with colleagues to help solve a problem. [Learn how to edit site navigation](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-the-navigation-on-your-sharepoint-site-3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

#### Edit the change management checklist
The Workplace transformation site contains a [Microsoft List](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) in **Site contents** that is displayed in a [List web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-list-web-part-ef0a1b80-f8b3-443d-b04a-1e76c70b5537) on the **Get started page**.

Or, you can [create a new list based on an existing Excel spreadsheet](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-based-on-a-spreadsheet-380cfeb5-6e14-438e-988a-c2b9bea574fa) or [use a list template](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-from-a-template-70b008a2-7a3d-4223-83d8-345e0313974d).
