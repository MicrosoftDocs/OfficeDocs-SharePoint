### Pre-populated content focuses on the hybrid workplace
The workplace transformation site features pre-populated content that revolves around helping organizations transition to a hybrid workplace. The hybrid workplace is one that is flexible when and where people do their work. Many organizations plan to allow employees to work from home up to 50% of the time, which means the organization will need to adopt new ways of working to ensure wellbeing and productivity.

2. Then you can edit list items, [change columns and labels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-column-in-a-list-or-library-2b0361ae-1bd3-41a3-8329-269e5f81cfa2), the theme and more. Or, you can [create a new list based on an existing Excel spreadsheet](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-based-on-a-spreadsheet-380cfeb5-6e14-438e-988a-c2b9bea574fa) or [use a list template](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-from-a-template-70b008a2-7a3d-4223-83d8-345e0313974d).

[Learn more about M365 lists](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

#### Use Microsoft 365 learning pathways to embed training content on a page
If your tenant admin has set up [M365 Learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/custom_plancontent), you can [add pages to the site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec) and use the [Learning pathways web part](/office365/customlearning/custom_addwebpart) to display custom training playlists. Then, use [Learning pathways reporting capabilities](/office365/customlearning/custom_measureimpact) to measure content impact.
<br>

#### Use tools to help target content to specific audiences or protect content from specific audiences
Consider using [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-content-to-a-specific-audience-on-a-sharepoint-site-68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to surface important content to specific groups or use [information barriers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/associate-information-segments-with-sharepoint-sites-2b03db07-6d3f-4297-a388-b943317a26a7#:~:text=%20Associate%20segments%20with%20a%20SharePoint%20site%20,10%20segments,%20and%20then%20select%20Save.%20More) to protect sensitive information that may appear in the **Managers** section under **Resources**. 


#### Update the site theme and branding
Edit the look of your site to align with your organization's brand.

#### Customize site navigation
Site navigation is important because it helps users immediately understand what can be accomplished on a given site. The most effective SharePoint sites help viewers find what they need quickly so that they can use the information to make decisions, learn about what is going on, access the tools they need, or engage with colleagues to help solve a problem. [Learn how to edit site navigation](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-the-navigation-on-your-sharepoint-site-3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).
