description: "Learn about changing the domain name in your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs"
---

# Change your SharePoint domain name (preview)

When you first signed up for Microsoft 365, you created an onmicrosoft.com domain. Even if you later added a custom domain, the original onmicrosoft.com domain is used for all your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. 

If your organization has gone through a rebranding, merger, or acquisition and needs to change the domain in your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs, you can now do this using PowerShell. For example, if your organization name changed from Contoso to Fabrikam, you can now change your SharePoint URLs from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWOnwY]

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is in public preview and currently available to organizations that have no more than 5000 total SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts combined. If you get error 773 "Not Implemented" when you try to start a domain rename, the feature isn't enabled yet for your organization because we're still rolling it out. Try again later.

> [!NOTE]
> - This change affects only SharePoint and OneDrive URLs. It doesn't impact email addresses.
> - For info about changing a site address, for example, from `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample1` to  `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample2`, see [Change a site address](change-site-address.md). 
> - This feature isn't available for organizations that have set up multi-geo. 
> - This feature is not available for Microsoft 365 Government GCC High and DoD customers.
> - When you rename your SharePoint domain, we create a redirect at the previous address.
> - You can only rename your SharePoint domain once every six months.
> - Changing your SharePoint domain name back to the original name after you rename it isn't supported. For example, if you change your SharePoint domain from `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, changing it back to `contoso.sharepoint.com` isn't supported.
>  - Redirects from the previous name are permanent and do not expire.

| Vanity domain configurations | If your SharePoint domain is, for example, teams.contoso.com (versus contoso.sharepoint.com), your domain name can't be changed. | No action available. |

## Step 1: Add the new domain name

1. Check the availability of the new domain you want. For example, if you want your SharePoint and OneDrive URLs to begin with `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, enter `https://fabrikam.sharepoint.com` in a browser. If you get a message that the address couldn’t be found (404), it’s probably available. If you get a sign-in screen or a message that your username couldn’t be found in the fabrikam.sharepoint.com directory, then the domain has already been taken and you’ll need to try a different one. If the domain is already registered by another customer, we can't provide any information or contact the customer. 

    -or-

    If you own the domain for another subscription, you need to [delete that tenant in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-delete-howto). Deleting a tenant typically takes three days to complete and to make the domain available. 

    > [!WARNING]
    > Do NOT use the domain to test this procedure in a test environment first. If you do, you won't be able to use the domain for your production environment.

2. Go to [https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain](https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must use the link [https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain](https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain) to go to the Custom domain names page in the Azure AD admin center. If you browse to the page instead of using the link, you won't be able to add your custom onmicrosoft.com domain successfully.

3. Select **Add custom domain**.

4. In the **Custom domain name** box, enter the full new “.onmicrosoft.com” domain, and then select **Add domain**.

    ![Custom domain name pane](media/custom-domain-name.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When adding the domain, it needs to be an “onmicrosoft.com” domain. For example, if you want to rename your tenant to fabrikam.sharepoint.com, the domain that you enter should be fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com. You do not need to purchase the “onmicrosoft.com” domain to add it and it does not require any public DNS registration.
 
5. If you get a message that the domain isn't available, try a different domain. 
 
6. After getting a confirmation that the domain was added successfully, you might see a message that the properties could not be found. Select the message to refresh domain references.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Do NOT add any other domains.
    > Do NOT configure the new domain as the initial domain.
    > If, after adding the domain, you are prompted to create a new TXT record with your domain name registrar, the domain has NOT been added correctly and you will NOT be able to perform a rename. If you are prompted, you will need to delete the invalid domain and return to Step 2.
 
7. In the navigation at the top of the page, select the name of your tenant to go back to the Custom domain names page. Make sure the onmicrosoft.com domain you added is on the list and the Status appears as Verified. 

    ![Domain status verified](media/domain-verified.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the status is NOT "Verified" then you will NOT be able to perform a rename. 

## Step 2: Use Microsoft PowerShell to rename your domain

> [!WARNING]
> Changing your SharePoint domain name might take several hours to days depending on the number of sites and OneDrive users that you have. We strongly recommend that you make this change during a period of low usage (like a weekend) and tell users to avoid accessing SharePoint and OneDrive content during the change. In addition, any actions that create new OneDrives and sites (such as creating a new team or private channel in Microsoft Teams) will be temporarily blocked during the rename. 
  
1. **REQUIRED** - [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell".
    > 
    > Make sure you review the System Requirements and Install Instructions. The app isn't supported on Mac.

2. Connect to SharePoint as a [global admin or SharePoint admin](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

   Example: 

   `Connect-SPOService -Url "https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com"`
    
3. Run the following command to specify the new domain name:
  
    ```PowerShell
    Start-SPOTenantRename -DomainName <DomainName> -ScheduledDateTime <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] 
    ```

    Where "DomainName" is the part before "sharepoint.com" or "onmicrosoft.com" and "ScheduledDateTime" is at least 24 hours in the future, but not more than 30 days. The time you enter is based on the current date and time of the computer you're using.

    Example: 

    `Start-SPOTenantRename -DomainName "fabrikam" -ScheduledDateTime "2021-12-31T10:25:00"`

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the PowerShell command Start-SPOTenantRename is not found or nothing is returned, make sure you installed the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell. Before installing the latest version, you might need to uninstall all previous versions by running `Uninstall-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -Force -AllVersions`. For more info about the Start-SPOTenantRename cmdlet, see [Start-SPOTenantRename](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/start-spotenantrename)

You can get the status of the rename by running `Get-SPOTenantRenameStatus`. Make sure you open a new PowerShell window to sign in again. The date and time shown with this command is in UTC format. [More info about Get-SPOTenantRenameStatus](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spotenantrenamestatus)

During and after the rename, you can get the state of a site by running `Get-SPOSiteRenameState`. For more info about this cmdlet, see [Get-SPOSiteRenameState](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spositerenamestate). 

To cancel a rename that has not started, you can run `Stop-SPOTenantRename`. [More info about this cmdlet](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/start-spotenantrename)

## Step 3: Review features and settings after the rename

1. Review any firewall rules that might block access to the new domain.

2. Review organization browser settings to make sure  the new domain is a trusted location. This includes reviewing any Group Policy settings that might control browser settings.

3. Review any third-party apps, custom apps, and scripts that access SharePoint. They might need to be modified to use the new domain.
