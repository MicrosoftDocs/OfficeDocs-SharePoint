# Check logs, limits and reports

See if the crawler has added content to the search index, and if your users are finding what they're looking for in SharePoint.
  
## View search usage reports
  
This article describes how you can use search reports in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219" target="_blank">SharePoint admin center</a> to find answers to questions about how search is being used in your organization. You can for example see the number of queries and the top queries. [Learn more](view-search-usage-reports-modern-sites.md).
  
## Query throttling
  
In SharePoint, you can't turn query throttling on or off, but you can use client-type information to make sure lower-priority clients like automated queries don't squeeze out higher-priority clients like UI. [Learn more](query-throttling.md).
  
## Set crawl log permissions
  
Use the crawl log to see if crawled content was successfully added to the search index, if it was excluded because of a crawl rule, or if indexing failed because of an error. [Learn more](set-crawl-log-permissions.md).
  
## Search limits
  
Look up the limits to SharePoint search. For example, there are limits to the number of entries you can have in a custom search dictionary and the number of results that can be returned for a query. [Learn more](search-limits.md).
