# Control access from unmanaged devices

As a SharePoint or global admin in Office 365, you can block or limit access to SharePoint and OneDrive content from unmanaged devices (those not [hybrid AD joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview#hybrid-azure-ad-joined-devices) or compliant in Intune). You can block or limit access for:
  
- All users in the organization or only some users or security groups.
    
- All sites in the organization or only some sites.
    
Blocking access helps provide security but comes at the cost of usability and productivity. When access is blocked, users will see the following error.

Limiting access allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss on unmanaged devices. When you limit access, users on managed devices will have full access (unless they use one of the browser and operating system combinations listed below). Users on unmanaged devices will have browser-only access with no ability to download, print, or sync files. They also won't be able to access content through apps, including the Microsoft Office desktop apps. When you limit access, you can choose to allow or block editing files in the browser. When web access is limited, users will see the following message at the top of sites.

> [!NOTE]
> Blocking or limiting access on unmanaged devices relies on Azure AD conditional access policies. [Learn about Azure AD licensing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) For an overview of conditional access in Azure AD, see [Conditional access in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview). For info about recommended SharePoint access policies, see [Policy recommendations for securing SharePoint sites and files](/microsoft-365/enterprise/sharepoint-file-access-policies). If you limit access on unmanaged devices, users on managed devices must use one of the [supported OS and browser combinations](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/technical-reference#client-apps-condition), or they will also have limited access.  
  
## Block access using the new SharePoint admin center 

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.)

3. If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center. 

4. In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, select **Access control**, and then select **Unmanaged devices**. 

5. Select **Block access**, and then select **Save**. (Note that selecting this option will disable any previous conditional access policies you created from this page and create a new conditional access policy that applies to all users. Any customizations you made to previous policies will not be carried over.)

    ![The Unmanaged devices pane in the new SharePoint admin center](media/unmanaged-devices-block-access.png) 

6. Go to the Azure AD admin center, and select **Azure Active Directory** in the left pane. 

7. Under **Security**, select **Conditional Access**. 

8. Select the policy **[SharePoint admin center]Use app-enforced Restrictions for browser access**. 

9. Select **Conditions**, and then select **Client apps**. "Browser" should already be selected. Select **Mobile apps and desktop clients**, select **Modern authentication clients** and **Other clients**, and then select **Done** twice. 

10. Make sure that under **Session**, **Use app enforced restrictions** appears, and make sure that **Enable policy** is **On**. 

11. Select **Save**. 

> [!NOTE] 
> **Conditional Access Session Control has two options:**
- **Use app-enforced Restrictions** 
  - This control only works with supported apps. Currently Exchange Online and SharePoint Online are the only cloud apps that support app enforced restrictions. Click here to learn more. [Use app enforced restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/controls#use-app-enforced-restrictions)

- **Conditional Access App control**
  - This control only works with featured apps. Click here to learn more. [Supported apps and clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-intro-aad#supported-apps-and-clients)

> [!NOTE] 
> It can take 5-10 minutes for the policy to take effect. It won't take effect for users who are already signed in from unmanaged devices. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you block or limit access from unmanaged devices, we recommend also blocking access from apps that don't use modern authentication. Some third-party apps and versions of Office prior to Office 2013 don't use modern authentication and can't enforce device-based restrictions. This means they allow users to bypass conditional access policies that you configure in Azure. In the new SharePoint admin center, on the Access control page, select **Apps that don't use modern authentication**, select **Block access**, and then select **Save**.

## Limit access using PowerShell

1. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).
    
2. Connect to SharePoint Online as a global admin or SharePoint admin in Office 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
    
3. Run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOTenant -ConditionalAccessPolicy AllowLimitedAccess`
    ```
    
> [!NOTE]
> By default, this policy allows users to view and edit files in their web browser. To change this, see [Advanced configurations](control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md#advanced). 
  
## Block or limit access to a specific SharePoint site or OneDrive 

To block or limit access to specific sites, you must set the organization-wide policy to "Allow full access from desktop apps, mobile apps, and the web." Then follow these steps to manually create a policy in the Azure AD admin center and run PowerShell cmdlets.
  
1. In the Azure AD admin center, select **Conditional access**, and then select **New policy**.
    
2. Under **Users and groups**, select whether you want the policy to apply to all users or only specific security groups.
    
3. Under **Cloud apps**, select **Office 365 SharePoint Online**.
    
4. Under **Conditions**, select **Client apps**, then select both **Mobile apps and desktop clients** and **Browser**.
    
5. Under **Session**, select **Use app enforced restrictions**. This tells Azure to use the settings you'll specify in SharePoint.
    
6. Enable the policy and save it.

7. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall “SharePoint Online Management Shell.” <br>On the Download Center page, select your language and then click the Download button. You’ll be asked to choose between downloading a x64 and x86 .msi file. Download the x64 file if you’re running the 64-bit version of Windows or the x86 file if you’re running the 32-bit version. If you don’t know, see https://support.microsoft.com/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system. After the file downloads, run it and follow the steps in the Setup Wizard. 
    
8. Connect to SharePoint Online as a global admin or SharePoint admin in Office 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
    
9. To block access to a single site, run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOSite -Identity https://<SharePoint online URL>/sites/<name of site or OneDrive account> -ConditionalAccessPolicy BlockAccess
    ```
    
    To limit access to a single site, run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOSite -Identity https://<SharePoint online URL>/sites/<name of site or OneDrive account> -ConditionalAccessPolicy AllowLimitedAccess
    ```

    To update multiple sites at once, use the following command as an example:

    ```PowerShell
    ,(Get-SPOSite -IncludePersonalSite $true -Limit all -Filter "Url -like '-my.sharepoint.com/personal/'") | Set-SPOSite -ConditionalAccessPolicy AllowLimitedAccess
    ```

    This example gets the OneDrive for every user and passes it as an array to Set-SPOSite to limit access. The initial comma and the parentheses are required for running this cmdlet as a batch request, which is fastest.

    
> [!NOTE]
> The site-level setting must be at least as restrictive as the organization-level setting. <br>By default, this policy allows users to view and edit files in their web browser. To change this, see [Advanced configurations](control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md#advanced). 
 
## Advanced configurations
<a name="advanced"> </a>

The following parameters can be used with  `-ConditionalAccessPolicy AllowLimitedAccess` for both the organization-wide setting and the site-level setting: 
  
 `-AllowEditing $false` Prevents users from editing Office files in the browser and copying and pasting Office file contents out of the browser window. 
  
 `-LimitedAccessFileType OfficeOnlineFilesOnly` Allows users to preview only Office files in the browser. This option increases security but may be a barrier to user productivity. 
  
 `-LimitedAccessFileType WebPreviewableFiles` (default) Allows users to preview Office files and other file types (such as PDF files and images) in the browser. Note that the contents of file types other than Office files are handled in the browser. This option optimizes for user productivity but offers less security for files that aren't Office files. 
  
 `-LimitedAccessFileType OtherFiles` Allows users to download files that can't be previewed, such as .zip and .exe. This option offers less security. 
  
The AllowDownlownloadingNonWebViewableFiles parameter has been discontinued. Please use LimitedAccessFileType instead.
  
External users will be affected when you use conditional access policies to block or limit access from unmanaged devices. If users have shared items with specific people (who must enter a verification code sent to their email address), you can exempt them from this policy by running the following cmdlet.
  
 `Set-SPOTenant -ApplyAppEnforcedRestrictionsToAdHocRecipients $false`
  
> [!NOTE]
> "Anyone" links (shareable links that don't require sign-in) are not affected by these policies. People who have an "Anyone" link to a file or folder will be able to download the item. For all sites where you enable conditional access policies, you should disable "Anyone" links. 
  
## App impact

Blocking access and blocking download may impact the user experience in some apps, including some Office apps. We recommend that you turn on the policy for some users and test the experience with the apps used in your organization. In Office, make sure to check the behavior in Flow and PowerApps when your policy is on.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Apps that run in "app-only" mode in the service, like antivirus apps and search crawlers, are exempted from the policy.</br>If you're using classic SharePoint site templates, site images may not render correctly. This is because the policy prevents the original image files from being downloaded to the browser.
