# Overview of crawled and managed properties in SharePoint Online
 
A  *crawled property*  is content and metadata that is extracted from an item, such as a document or a URL, during a crawl. A crawled property can be an author, title, or subject. To include the content and metadata of crawled properties in the search index, you map crawled properties to managed properties. Managed properties can have a large number of settings, or attributes. These attributes determine how the contents are shown in search results. The search schema contains the attributes on managed properties and the mapping between crawled properties and managed properties. For more information, see [Overview of the search schema in SharePoint Server](../../SharePoint/SharePointServer/search/search-schema-overview.md) and [Manage the search schema in SharePoint Online](manage-search-schema.md).
  
## Managed properties overview

For a list of default managed properties and their attributes inherited from SharePoint Server see [Overview of crawled and managed properties in SharePoint Server](../SharePointServer/technical-reference/crawled-and-managed-properties-overview.md).

The following table lists the default managed properties and their attributes specific to SharePoint Online. For each managed property that by default is mapped to one or several crawled properties, these crawled properties are listed in the **Mapped Crawled Properties** column.
