# Create and manage terms in a term set

To create and manage terms, you must be a contributor, a group manager, or a term store admin. (If you have many terms that you want to add, consider [importing them](https://support.office.com/article/168fbc86-7fce-4288-9a1f-b83fc3921c18).)
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are adding a term to a local term set, you must [open term store management at the site level](open-term-store-management-tool.md#open-term-store-management-for-a-site). 

To create a term in a term set
  
1. In the SharePoint admin center, under **Content services**, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185073" target="_blank">**Term store**</a>.
    
2. In the tree-view pane, select the term set to which you want to add a term.

3. Click **Add term**.

4. Type a name for the term and press ENTER.
    
5. Update the term settings as needed: 
    
    - On the **General** tab, to add languages, translations, and synonyms, select **Add**. The **Add translation and synonyms** panel appears. Select your language, translation, description, and add synonyms. Select **Save**.

    - On the **Usage settings** tab, to make the term available to the users and content editors of sites consuming this term set, select **Edit**. The **Available for tagging** panel appears. By default, the term is enabled for tagging. To disable, select the **Enable** checkbox. Select **Save**.

    - On the **Advanced** tab, to use shared or local custom properties to store additional data about term sets, select **Edit**. The **Edit shared custom properties** panel appears. Add property names and values. Select **Save**.
