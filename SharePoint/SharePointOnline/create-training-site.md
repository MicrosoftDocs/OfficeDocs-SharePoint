# Guided walkthrough: Creating a Training site for your organization

In this article, we show you elements of an example Training site to inspire you, and help you learn how to create similar sites for your own organization. This example site provides info about a specific event and guides the user toward learning and registration. It relies on visual impact to engage and motivate the visitor.

First, if you haven't already created a Communication site, check out the [Create your site](#create-your-site) section in this article. If you need to learn how to edit and publish the page on your site, check out the section [Edit, work with sections and web parts, and publish](#manage-sections-and-web-parts) in this article.

Once you have your created your site and know how to edit pages, you can use the guidance below to add the elements shown.

## Create your site

To make a site like the one shown here, you'll create a [Communication site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-topic-showcase-and-blank-communication-site-templates-94a33429-e580-45c3-a090-5512a8070732). To do this, select **Create site** from the SharePoint start page (or, if you're going to associate this site with a Hub site, navigate to the hub site and select **Create site** there so that the communication site is automatically associated with that hub site).

![Image of the Create site option](media/ts-2.png)

Next, choose **Communication site**, and then the **Topic** layout. Fill out your site name, description, and other information, and select **Finish**. Then you'll get a template with the same type of layout as the example in this article.

![Image of the Communication site dashboard](media/ts-3.jpg)

For more details, see [Create a communication site in SharePoint Online](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb).

## Logo and site classification

In this example, the header area does not contain any navigation because it is intended to be a "stand-alone" page. However, the header area does contain a custom logo, and shows a label indicating that the site is classified as "Internal Only." Site classification uses values such as internal, confidential, high business impact, low business impact, and so on. These values can pertain to sensitivity of information or to the life cycle of information.

![Image of the site logo](media/ts-4.png)

To learn how to change the logo and classify your site, see [Manage your SharePoint site settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-a-site-s-title-description-logo-and-site-information-settings-8376034d-d0c7-446e-9178-6ab51c58df42).

## Manage sections and web parts

Start editing by clicking **Edit** on the top right of the page.

![Image of the Edit option](media/ts-5.png)

While editing, on the left, below the header your drafts can be saved for later or discarded.

![Image of the section toolbar](media/ts-6.png)

The + symbol before or after a section will add a section using one of several layouts.

![Image of the section layout options](media/ts-7.png)

Sections make up your page, and are you place one or more web parts. While editing the page, each section will show controls to edit the layout, move, or delete the sections. For information on working with sections, see [Add or remove sections and columns on a page](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899).

![Image of the Add section option](media/ts-8.png)

Select the plus symbol ![Image of the plus icon](media/ts-18.png) in a section, which may appear before or after a web part in a section, to see the many types of web parts available. For more information on all web parts, see [Using web parts on SharePoint pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/using-web-parts-on-sharepoint-pages-336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0).

![Image of the add section icon](media/ts-19.png)

Web parts may be edited, moved, or deleted within sections. The **Edit web part** icon opens detailed controls unique to each web part type.

![Image of the edit tool bar](media/ts-9.png)

When your page updates are ready, select **Publish** to make them visible to your entire organization.

![Image of the publish icon](media/ts-10.png)

> [!TIP]
> To manage all of your pages on the site, click **Pages** on the top menu.

## Create impact with the Hero web part

Let your visitors know the focus of your Workshop with the Hero web part. The layout used in this example is **Two tiles**.

**Hero layout: Tiles or Layers**:

Editing the web part presents layout options. The **Tiles** option presents layouts for between one and five tiles. The **Layers** option sets each image as a layer with the image next to the title. Up to five layers are possible allowing one web part to create an entire page.

**Each tile can be edited**:

Use the **Move item** control on the left to rearrange the tiles within the Hero web part. Controls on the right allow you to **Edit details** adjusting the text and image used, **Set focal point** for the hover animation, plus **Zoom in** and **Zoom out** of the image.

In this example, the Hero web part is in a full-width section.

![Image of the Hero web part](media/ts-11.png)

For more details on using the Hero web part, see Use the [Hero web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-hero-web-part-d57f449b-19a0-4b0d-8ce3-be5866430645).

[**Back to top**](#example-training-site)

## Show event dates

The Events web part automatically displays event information. The events shown are controlled by filters for **Source**, **Event list**, **Category**, and **Date range**. Events can be shown with detailed summaries in **Filmstrip** view or in a **Compact** view.

In this Workshop site example, this web part uses the **Filmstrip** layout.

![Image of the Event web part](media/ts-12.png)

For more details on using the Events web part, see [Use the Events web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-events-web-part-5fe4da93-5fa9-4695-b1ee-b0ae4c981909).

[**Back to top**](#example-training-site)

## Describe the event with the Text web part

The leadership drop quote and the Monthly Q&A descriptions use the Text web part. This web part allows basic text formatting for creating fixed sections of formatted text.

When editing text, this web part will offer basic formatting tools to set styles and add enhancements like **bold** and *italics*. Clicking the ... control at the right end of the formatting toolbar offers additional options to the right of the web part.

In this Workshop site example shown above, the web part is in a one-column section.

![Image of the Text web part](media/ts-13.png)

For more details on using the Text web part, see [Add text and tables to your page with the Text web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-text-and-tables-to-your-page-with-the-text-web-part-729c0aa1-bc0d-41e3-9cde-c60533f2c801).

[**Back to top**](#example-training-site)

## Guide users to key actions with Quick links

The Quick links web part offers several easy to use menu formats for listing links to other pages or sites.

In this site example, the web part uses the **Button** layout for quick and easy reference.

![Image of the Quick links web part](media/ts-14.png)

For more details on using the Quick Links web part, see [Use the Quick Links web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-quick-links-web-part-e1df7561-209d-4362-96d4-469f85ab2a82).

[**Back to top**](#example-training-site)

## Use images with links

The Image web part places a fixed image on the page. Images can be photographs, diagrams, or even used to bring impact to text. Captions and alt-text keep images accessible.

![Image of the Image web part](media/ts-15.png)

For more details on using the Image web part, see [Use the Image web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-image-web-part-a63b335b-ad0a-4954-a65d-33c6af68beb2).

## Add maps with the Bing Maps web part

The Bing Maps web part offers an easy visual map reference and quick link to allow visitors to plan their route to your workshop.

![Image of the Bing maps web part](media/ts-16.png)

For more details on using the Bing Maps web part, see [Use the Bing Maps web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-bing-maps-web-part-c0e3f2f6-dc0d-49df-9308-1bf7c888e794).

[**Back to top**](#example-training-site)

## Add forms for registration

If you created a form for registration using [Microsoft Forms](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-form-with-microsoft-forms-4ffb64cc-7d5d-402f-b82e-b1d49418fd9d), you can place that form directly on the page with the Microsoft Forms web part. It's an easy way for attendees to fill out their information, and an easy way for you to collect it.

![Image of the Microsoft forms web part](media/ts-17.png)

For more details on using the Microsoft Forms web part, see [Use the Microsoft Forms web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-microsoft-forms-web-part-d4b4d3ce-7860-41e4-8a98-76380efe7256).
