# Delete a site collection

When you, as a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, delete a site collection, it's moved to the site collection Recycle Bin and are retained for 93 days. Deleting the site collection deletes everything within it, including:
  
- Document libraries and files.
    
- Lists and list data.
    
- Site settings and history.
    
- Any subsites and their contents.
    
You should notify the site collection owners and subsite owners before you delete a site collection so they can move their data to another location, and also tell users when the sites will be deleted.
