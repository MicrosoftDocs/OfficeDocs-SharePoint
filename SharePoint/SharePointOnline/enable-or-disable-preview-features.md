> [!NOTE]
> The **Preview Features** setting isn't related to the Targeted release option, which allows you to receive new updates and features as they become available. If you're interested in signing up for that, see [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Microsoft 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365).
