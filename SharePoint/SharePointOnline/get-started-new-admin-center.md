# Get started with the new SharePoint admin center

To access the new SharePoint admin center:

Go to the [home page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=home&modern=true), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have Office 365 Germany, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the Sharing page. <br>If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center, and open the home page.

> [!NOTE]
> [Microsoft Partners](/office365/admin/misc/add-partner) can't access the new SharePoint admin center. <br>Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the [Targeted release option in Office 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365). This means that you might not yet see some features described in this article, or they might look different.

## View reports

On the home page, at a glance, you can see:
  
- The number of files that have specific types of activity each day for the past 30 days. (If an activity occurs multiple times in one day on the same file, the file is counted only once for that day.)
    
- The number of total and active sites each day for the past 30 days. ("Active" sites are any where users view a page or view, modify, upload, download, share, or sync a file.)

>  To filter a report, select an item in the legend. For example, on the **Files by activity type** chart, select **Viewed or edited**. <br>  To see values for a specific day, point to that day on the report. </br>  To see more details about a report, open the report in the Microsoft 365 admin center by selecting **Details**. Here, you can see tables of activity by site or users, change the reporting period, pivot the report, export the report data into a .csv file that you can open in Excel, and more.

## View Message center posts

In the **Message center** section of the home page, to help you manage upcoming changes, you can read official announcements about new and changed SharePoint features.

To sort and filter the [list of messages across all Office 365 services](/office365/admin/manage/message-center), select **All active messages**.
