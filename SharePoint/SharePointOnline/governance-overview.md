# SharePoint governance overview

Governance is the set of policies, roles, responsibilities, and processes that control how your organization's business divisions and IT teams work together to achieve its goals. We recommend that you consider [governance first](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/solutions/collaboration-governance-first) as you start working with SharePoint. Having a governance plan in place early can help your organization stay compliant with your business processes and regulations.

Two of the primary ways SharePoint is used in an organization are *intranet sites* and *collaboration*. See [Planning intranet governance](intranet-governance.md) and [Overview of collaboration governance in Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/solutions/collaboration-governance-overview) for a look at governance in these two areas.

### Related services

SharePoint is tightly integrated with other Microsoft 365 services, including Microsoft 365 Groups, Teams, and Yammer. It's important to think about SharePoint governance in a way that's inclusive of these other services. Microsoft 365 includes a variety of options to enable your governance policies across SharePoint and related services, including Teams, Planner, Stream, Outlook, Yammer and Microsoft 365 Groups.

To see how SharePoint governance capabilities overlap with other Microsoft 365 services, see:
