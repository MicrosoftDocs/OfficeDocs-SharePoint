## Create your site

To make a site like the one shown here, you'll create a [Communication site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-topic-showcase-and-blank-communication-site-templates-94a33429-e580-45c3-a090-5512a8070732). To do this, select **Create site** from the SharePoint start page (or, if you're going to associate this site with a Hub site, navigate to the hub site and select Create site there so that the communication site is automatically associated with that hub site).

![Image of the command bar](media/gw-leadership/gw-2.png)

Next, choose **Communication site**, and then the **Blank** layout. Fill out your site name, description, and other information, and select **Finish**.

![Image of a Communication site with Blank layout selected](media/gw-leadership/gw-3.png)

For more information, see [Create a communication site in SharePoint Online](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb).

## Showcase your company branding

You can quickly and easily customize the look of your SharePoint site to reflect your professional style and brand.

**Change the look** settings are located under **Settings** ![Image of the settings gear icon](media/gw-leadership/gw-settings.png) in the top right corner of your SharePoint site.

![Image of the settings pane](media/gw-leadership/gw-5.png)

You can select the site theme you want, and even customize it.

![Image of the site theme options](media/gw-leadership/gw-6.png)

You can change your header layout and logo when you select **Header** under **Change the look**.

![Image of the site header options](media/gw-leadership/gw-7.png)

Under Change the look, you can also find options for navigation (cascade or mega menu) and footer options. For more details on changing the look of your site, see [Change the look of your SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-the-look-of-your-sharepoint-site-06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818).

## Make your site easy to get around

Easily edit the left and top menus to link the page to other SharePoint pages or on the Internet.

![Image of the navigation edit pane](media/gw-leadership/gw-8.png)

Select **Edit** on the bottom of the left navigation to manage links there, or on the top menu to manage links there. Hover over the location in the menu where you want to add a link, and select +. Then add the type of link you want to add, your website address, and name to display in the navigation bar in the **Add a link** dialog box. Want to reorder your navigation links? Just drag them into the position you want.

For more detailed information on navigation, see [Customize the navigation on your SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-the-navigation-on-your-sharepoint-site-3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca).

## Add sections and web parts

Sections make up your page, and are where you place one or more web parts. While editing the page, each section will show controls to edit the layout, move, or delete the sections.

Start editing by clicking **Edit** on the top right of the page.

![Image of the edit button at the top of the page](media/gw-leadership/gw-9.png)

The + symbol before or after a section will add a section using one of several layouts.

![Image of the page layout options](media/gw-leadership/gw-10.png)

For information on working with sections, see [Add or remove sections and columns on a page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899).

To add web parts to sections, select the plus symbol ![image of a plus symbol](media/gw-leadership/gw-plus.png) in a section, which may appear before or after a web part in a section. Then select a web part to use. For more information on all web parts, see [Using web parts on SharePoint pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/using-web-parts-on-sharepoint-pages-336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0).

![Image of featured web parts](media/gw-leadership/gw-11.png)

Web parts may be edited, moved, or deleted within sections. The **Edit web part** icon opens detailed controls unique to each web part type.

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Focus on priorities with the Hero web part

Let your team know what's most important with high-impact hero images, company branding, and important news. The initial impact of the Leadership site home page is created by large and eye-catching images of the Hero web part. The layout used in this example is **Three tiles**.

### Hero layout

Editing the web part presents layout options. The **Tiles** option, such as the one shown below, presents layouts for between one and five tiles. The **Layers** option sets each image as a layer with the image next to the title. Up to five layers are possible, so that you can use the web part to fill the entire page.

In this example, the Hero web part is in a full-width section.

Use the **Move item** ![Image of the Move icon](media/gw-leadership/gw-move.png) button on the left to rearrange the tiles within the Hero web part.

![Image of the Hero web part tile customization options](media/gw-leadership/gw-13.png)

### Customize each tile

When you select a tile, you'll see a toolbar at the bottom of the tile where you can select **Edit details** where you can change the link and image used. With the larger tile, you can also set call to action text and link. On the same toolbar, you can set focal point for the hover animation, plus zoom in and zoom out of the image.

![Image of the Hero web part Edit details pane](media/gw-leadership/gw-14.png)

For more details on using the Hero web part, see [Use the Hero web part](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-hero-web-part-d57f449b-19a0-4b0d-8ce3-be5866430645).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Share timely news with the News web part

The News web part provides controls to choose the **News Source** and **Layout**, and to **Organize** and **Filter** the content. Under **Layout**, there are five options to adjust now news items are presented. In this example, news stories are coming the site as the source, and the **Top story** layout. The stories are presented side by side with large images because only two news stories on the site are published.

In this example, the web part is in a one-column section.

For more details on using the News web part, see [Use the News web part on a SharePoint page](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Connect to important resources with the Quick Links web part

With the Quick links web part, you have the ability to easily create professional, on-page menus for listing links to other pages or sites. In this example, the web part is using the **Compact** layout, but other layouts, like Button and Filmstrip, are available.

In this Leadership site example shown above, this web part is in the second column of a two-column section.

![Image of the Quick links web part edit pane](media/gw-leadership/gw-15.png)

For more details on using the Quick links web part, see [Use the Quick Links web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-quick-links-web-part-e1df7561-209d-4362-96d4-469f85ab2a82).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Add video with the Stream web part

Using the [Microsoft Stream service](/stream/overview), you can add Stream videos to your page for enhanced visuals and higher user engagement.

In this Leadership site example shown above, this web part is in the first column of a two-column section.

![Image of the Stream web part](media/gw-leadership/gw-16.png)

For more details on using the Stream web part, see [Use the Stream web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-stream-classic-web-part-b97fa87c-1337-4271-a059-17f0d2b26e8b).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Keep communication fresh with the Viva Engage web part

With Viva Engage, you can have organization-wide conversations. Now you can have those conversations right on your page with the Viva Engage **Conversations** web part. In this example, the conversation is being pulled from a Viva Engage group called Leadership.

In this Leadership site example shown above, this web part is in the first column of a two-column section.

![Image of the Viva Engage web part](media/gw-leadership/gw-17.png)

For more details on using the Viva Engage web part, see [Use a Viva Engage web part in SharePoint Online](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Engage users with a second Hero web part

The Hero web part doesn't have to be for the top of the page only. In this example, a second hero web part further down the page uses the **Layers** layout with two rows to display larger images.

![Image of the Hero web part](media/gw-leadership/gw-18.png)

Learn more about the [Hero web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-hero-web-part-d57f449b-19a0-4b0d-8ce3-be5866430645).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Keep everyone up to date with the Events web part

The Events web part allows you to easily display upcoming events on your page. In this example, leadership events are highlighted.

In this Leadership site example, the web part is in the second column of a two-column section.

![Image of the Events web part](media/gw-leadership/gw-19.png)

Learn more about the Events web part in [Use the Events web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-events-web-part-5fe4da93-5fa9-4695-b1ee-b0ae4c981909).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Add a Call to action web part

The Call to action web part allows you to create a button with a call to action for users. In this example, it's used to encourage and direct employees to sign up for a speaker session.

In this Leadership site example, the web part is in the second column of a two-column section.

![Image of the Call to action web part](media/gw-leadership/gw-20.png)

For more details on how to use this web part, see [Use the Call to action web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-call-to-action-web-part-e9917310-7543-4fc4-8f3f-d78e46074c00).

[Back to top](#lets-get-started)

## Make words matter using the Text web part

### Enhance the message

The leadership quote uses the Text web part. This web part allows basic text formatting, including styles and tables, for creating fixed sections of formatted text. In this example, the Text web part is using the **Pull quote** style. Clicking the **...** control at the right end of the formatting toolbar offers more options to the right of the web part.

In this Leadership site example shown above, the web part is in a one-column section.

![Image of the Text web part](media/gw-leadership/gw-21.png)

For more details on using the Text web part, see [Add text and tables to your page with the Text web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-text-and-tables-to-your-page-with-the-text-web-part-729c0aa1-bc0d-41e3-9cde-c60533f2c801).
