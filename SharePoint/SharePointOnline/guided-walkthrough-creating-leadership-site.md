Sections make up your page, and are you place one or more web parts. While editing the page, each section will show controls to edit the layout, move, or delete the sections.

Start editing by clicking **Edit** on the top right of the page.

<!-- daisy image 9-->

The + symbol before or after a section will add a section using one of several layouts.

<!-- daisy image 10-->

For information on working with sections, see [Add or remove sections and columns on a page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899).

To add web parts to sections, select the plus symbol <!--daisy plus symbol--> in a section, which may appear before or after a web part in a section. Then select a web part to use.

<!-- daisy image 11-->

Web parts may be edited, moved or deleted within sections. The **Edit web part** icon opens detailed controls unique to each web part type.

## Focus on priorities with the Hero web part

Let your team know what’s most important with high-impact hero images, company branding, and important news. The initial impact of the Leadership site home page is created by large and eye-catching images of the Hero web part. The layout used in this example is **Three tiles**.

### Hero layout

Editing the web part presents layout options. The **Tiles** option, such as the one shown below, presents layouts for between one and five tiles. The **Layers** option sets each image as a layer with the image next to the title. Up to five layers are possible, so that you can use the web part to fill the entire page.

In this example, the Hero web part is in a full-width section.

Use the **Move item** <!--daisy move item icon--> button on the left to rearrange the tiles within the Hero web part.

<!-- daisy image 13-->

### Customize each tile

When you click a tile, you'll see a toolbar at the bottom of the tile where you can click **Edit details** where you can change the link and image used. With the larger tile, you can also set call to action text and link. On the same toolbar, you can set focal point for the hover animation, plus zoom in and zoom out of the image.

## Share timely news with the News web part

The News web part provides controls to choose the **News Source** and **Layout**, and to **Organize** and **Filter** the content. Under **Layout**, there are five options to adjust now news items are presented. In this example, news stories are coming the site as the source, and the **Top story** layout. The stories are presented side-by-side with large images because only two news stories on the site are published.

In this example, the web part is in a one-column section.

## Connect to important resources with the Quick Links web part

With the Quick links web part, you have the ability to easily create professional, on-page menus for listing links to other pages or sites. In this example, the web part is using the **Compact** layout, but other layouts, like Button and Filmstrip, are available.

## Keep communication fresh with the Yammer web part

With Yammer, you can have organization-wide conversations. Now you can have those conversations right on your page with the Yammer **Conversations** web part. In this example, the conversation is being pulled from a Yammer group called Leadership.

## Engage users with beautiful images with a second Hero web part

The Hero web part doesn't have to be for the top of the page only. In this example, a second hero web part further down the page uses the **Layers** layout with two rows to display larger images.

<!-- daisy image 18-->

## Sign them up with the Call to action web part

The Call to action web part allows you to create a button with a call to action for users. In this example, it's used to encourage and direct employees to sign up for a speaker session.

## Inspire with a quote using the Text web part

### Enhance the message

The leadership quote uses the Text web part. This web part allows basic text formatting, including styles and tables, for creating fixed sections of formatted text. In this example, the Text web part is using the **Pull quote** style. Clicking the **…** control at the right end of the formatting toolbar offers additional options to the right of the web part.
