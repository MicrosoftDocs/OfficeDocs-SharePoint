# Guided walkthrough: Creating an organization site

In this article, we show you elements of an example SharePoint enterprise landing site to inspire you and help you learn how to create similar sites for your own organization. In this example, the site emphasizes news, resources, and personalized content. You'll see which web parts on used in different sections, along with links for more information on each web part.

First, if you haven't already created a Communication site, check out the Create your site section in this article.

Once you have your created your site and know how to edit pages, you can use the steps below to add the elements shown.

## Example SharePoint enterprise landing site

|Web part|Description|
|----------|------------|
|![Image of an example enterprise landing site](media/gw-org/gw-org-long.png)|**1 Navigation** <br> Quickly guide visitors to the information they're looking for with site navigation. <br> [Learn how](#navigation) <br> <br> <br> **2 News and events** <br> Keep everyone up to date on the latest happenings. <br> [Learn how](#keep-everyone-up-to-date) <br> <br> <br> **3 Quick links** <br> Format the Quick links web part with icons, images, and descriptions. <br> [Learn how](#quick-links) <br> <br> <br> **4 Important information** <br> Display important documents and files. <br> [Learn how](#documents-and-files) <br> <br> <br> **5 Personalization** <br> Use web parts designed to dynamically provide personalized information for the user. <br> [Learn how](#personalized-web-parts)|

## Create your site

To make a site like the one shown here, you'll create a [Communication site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-topic-showcase-and-blank-communication-site-templates-94a33429-e580-45c3-a090-5512a8070732?storagetype=live). To do this, select **Create site** from the SharePoint start page (or, if you're going to associate this site with a Hub site, navigate to the hub site and select **Create site** there so that the communication site is automatically associated with that hub site).

![Image of the command bar](media/gw-leadership/gw-2.png)

Next, choose **Communication site**, and then the **Topic** layout. Fill out your site name, description, and other information, and select **Finish**. Then you'll get a template with the same type of layout as the example in this article.

![Image of the edit pane for the Topic layout](media/gw-org/org-3.jpg)

## Manage sections and web parts

Sections make up your page, and are where you place one or more web parts. While editing the page, each section will show controls to edit the layout, move, or delete the sections.

If your page isn't already in edit mode, select **Edit** on the top right of the page.

![Image of the edit button at the top of the page](media/gw-leadership/gw-9.png)

The + symbol before or after a section will add a section using one of several layouts.

![Image of the available section layouts](media/gw-team/gw-team-2.png)

For more information on working with sections, see [Add or remove sections and columns on a page](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899).

To add a web part to a section, select the plus symbol ![Image of the plus symbol](media/gw-leadership/gw-plus.png), which may appear before or after a web part in a section. For more information on all web parts, see [Using web parts on SharePoint pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/using-web-parts-on-sharepoint-pages-336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0).

![Image of the featured web parts that appear when you select the plus symbol](media/gw-leadership/gw-11.png)

Web parts may be edited, moved, or deleted within sections. The **Edit web part** icon opens detailed controls unique to each web part type.

[Back to top](#example-sharepoint-enterprise-landing-site)

## Keep everyone up to date

The Enterprise Landing page uses two different [News web parts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165). One uses the **Carousel** layout, and the other uses the **Top story** layout. In the example [at the beginning of the article](#example-sharepoint-enterprise-landing-site), these layouts are both in the first column of two-column [sections](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-an-organization-site-9c1842c3-543e-4891-85d3-0eaf680e242d?storagetype=live#bkmk_sectionswebparts) on the page. The second column contains an [Events web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-events-web-part-5fe4da93-5fa9-4695-b1ee-b0ae4c981909) that you can use to display upcoming events and activities. The second example photo below includes the [Countdown timer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-countdown-timer-web-part-a13ffef8-0bf1-409e-be23-98af1d1736e7) to generate excitement for things like an upcoming event, activity, or launch.

## Quick links

You can use buttons, icons, and descriptions to turn simple links into engaging guidance to help visitors find the sites they need.

In the example below, the Quick links web part is in a separate, one-column [section](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-an-organization-site-9c1842c3-543e-4891-85d3-0eaf680e242d?storagetype=live#bkmk_sectionswebparts).

In this Enterprise landing site example at the [beginning of the article](#example-sharepoint-enterprise-landing-site), this web part uses the List layout with icons and descriptions added. To get this look, choose **Show descriptions** when you choose the **List** layout for the [Quick Links web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-quick-links-web-part-e1df7561-209d-4362-96d4-469f85ab2a82). Then, use the Edit pencil under each individual link where you can add your own description. Then, use the **Edit** pencil icon under each individual link to add your own description.

![Image of the Quick links web part](media/gw-org/org-12.png)

## Documents and files

Display a file on the page with the [File viewer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-file-viewer-web-part-e53a9602-e7b3-4fff-9126-de2f18d1900c). You can display Word, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, and 3D model files, and many more types. In the example, two File viewer web parts are shown in two columns. One displays a Word document, and one displays a PowerPoint presentation.

![Image of the File viewer web part displaying a Word document](media/gw-org/org-14.png)

![Image of the File viewer web part displaying a PowerPoint](media/gw-org/org-15.png)

[Back to top](#example-sharepoint-enterprise-landing-site)

## Personalized web parts

Recent sites (left column), Highlighted content (middle column), and News (right column) web parts are in a separate, three-column section. Each can filter content based on the current viewer of the site. These kinds of web parts used in this way can help draw viewers back to the page to see their latest visited sites, content, and news.

![Image of a three-column section showing recent sites, Highlighted Content, and News](media/gw-org/org-13.png)

For more information on using these web parts, see [Use the Sites web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sites-web-part-93cbd17b-0bf8-4355-9f32-cc90e0443e6d), [Use the Highlighted content web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-highlighted-content-web-part-e34199b0-ff1a-47fb-8f4d-dbcaed329efd), and [Use the News web part on a SharePoint page](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165).
