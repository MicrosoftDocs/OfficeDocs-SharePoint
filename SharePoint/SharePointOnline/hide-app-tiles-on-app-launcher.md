# Hide the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles

By default, the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles appear in the app launcher and on the Microsoft 365 admin center​. If your subscription doesn't include one of these services, or if you don't want users using one of them, you can hide the app tile for it.

> [!NOTE]
> Hiding these services doesn't remove them for users. If users have saved the address of the service, they will still be able to access it. <br> If users click a tile for a service they don't have, they will see an Access Denied message.
