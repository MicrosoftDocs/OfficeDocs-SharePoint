# Hide the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles

By default, the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles appear in the app launcher and on the Office 365 portal. If your subscription doesn't include one of these services, or if you don't want users using one of them, you can hide the app tile for it.

> [!NOTE]
> Hiding these services doesn't remove them for users. If users have saved the address of the service, they will still be able to access it. <br> If users click a tile for a service they don't have, they will see an Access Denied message. 
  
## To hide app tiles
<a name="__top"> </a>

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin to open the Microsoft 365 admin center. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the **Admin** tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane of the admin center, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint** to open the SharePoint admin center. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center. 
    
3. In the left pane, select **Settings**. 

4. At the bottom of the page, select **classic settings page**.
    
5. In **Show or Hide App Tiles**, choose the tile you want to hide.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have an Office 365 Education subscription, you also have the option to hide **OneNote Class Notebooks** and **OneNote Staff Notebooks**. <br>> Hiding the OneDrive tile also hides the tiles for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. 
  
6. Select **OK** to save the settings.
