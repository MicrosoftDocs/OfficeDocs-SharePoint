# Hide the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles

By default, the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles appear in the app launcher and on the Microsoft 365 admin center. If your subscription doesn't include one of these services, or if you don't want users using one of them, you can hide the app tile for it.

> [!NOTE]
> Hiding these services doesn't remove them for users. If users have saved the address of the service, they will still be able to access it. <br> If users click a tile for a service they don't have, they will see an Access Denied message.
