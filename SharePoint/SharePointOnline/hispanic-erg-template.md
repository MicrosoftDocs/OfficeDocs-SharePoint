## How to get the Hispanic Heritage Employee Resource Group site: 

| Step 1: Provision | Step 2: Customize | Step 3: Share | 
| :------------------: | :------------------: |:---------------:| 
| Navigate to the [custom PnP site templates](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/applying-pnp-templates) and select the template you need | Follow guidance on this page to customize the site | Share the site with the rest of your organization | 

## Step 1: Provision the site  

1. Go to the Hispanic Heritage Employee Resource Group template page. 
2. Select **Add to your tenant**. If you aren't signed into to your tenant, the SharePoint Look Book asks for your site collection admin credentials. 
3. From the permissions requested dialog box, select **Consent on behalf of your organization** and then select **Accept.** 

   >[!NOTE] 
   > The provisioning service requires these permissions to provision the site template. There is no overall impact on your tenant, and these permissions are used for the solution installation. You must accept these permissions to proceed with the installation. 

4. Complete the fields on the provisioning information page as appropriate for your installation. At a minimum, enter the email address where you wish to get notifications about the provisioning process and the URL prefix for your site to be provisioned to. 
5. Select **Provision** when ready to install the site into your tenant environment.  
   - The provisioning process takes up to 20 minutes. 
   - You'll be notified via email (to the notification email address you entered on the Provisioning page) when the site is ready for access. 

### Next, add owners to the site 

As the site collection admin, you may not be the person customizing the site, so you need to assign a few site owners. Owners have administrative privileges on the site so they can modify site pages, content, and branding. 

1. Select **Share** in the right-hand corner of the site. 
2. Add users, Microsoft 365 Groups, or security groups to give them access to the site. 
3. Assign users as a Site owner to allow permission to customize the site. 
4. Include the site URL in the Share message, and then select **Share.** 

## Step 2: Customize the site 

After the site has been provisioned and site owners have been added, it's time to customize the site to make it your own. Customize the site’s look, navigation, and content like news posts and events. 

#### Start by signing into Microsoft 365 and navigating to the site

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [office.com](https://www.office.com/) or your organization’s sign-in location. 
2. Sign in with your username and password. 
3. Navigate to the site's location using the URL supplied by your site collection admin, or select SharePoint from the Microsoft 365 home page, and then select the site. 


#### Next, explore prepopulated content:

- **Home page –** The landing page features a unique theme, colorful images, and more inspirational content that is relevant and engaging. Content here's inspired by Hispanic and Latinx employee resource groups but can be adapted to other types of groups. Customize the Text, News, Events, and Quick Links web parts to make this site your own. 
- **Page template –** A page template with a unique theme can be found in the site’s contents to help create news posts and pages for the site more quickly.  
- **News web part –** Prepopulated news posts were created using the page template.
