# Hold a town hall in Yammer and keep the conversation going

Bring your organization together to communicate the overall state of the business, status of large-scale projects, success stories, and growth opportunities. Create an end-to-end live event experience in Yammer that engages audiences before, during, and after the event.

Organizations often call their large-scale events for employees a town hall. Sometimes organizations refer to a town hall as an all-hands meeting or all-company meeting. In this example, we’ll be referring to this type of meeting as an organization town hall, but the steps and guidance can be used the same way for similar meetings and live events in Yammer.

Get started preparing and implementing a town hall that is on demand, secure, accessible to all audiences, and allows you to keep the conversation going after the live event.  


**Town halls can help bring your organization together by:**

- Sharing information in a meaningful and engaging format
- Building trust and connections across an organization
- Broadcasting to large groups of people at one time 
- Expanding community and employee engagement through shared experiences
- Keeping the conversation going in channels related to the town hall
- Using live event analytics to understand event reach and engagement 
- Connecting employees and teams through hybrid work

## Plan a town hall

Since town halls reach broad and diverse audiences, you’ll want to consider the needs and preferences of your audience and make sure content can be accessed before, during, and after the event.

![Infographic of the town hall planning process](media/th2.png)

**Planning considerations:**
- The town hall is a virtual live event and can be accessed by different people across different regions and time zones.
- Many people will attend using a mobile device.
- Some people won’t attend the live event, but will want to watch the event recording later.
- Some people won’t watch the full recording, but will want to see highlights of the most important information therefore after the town hall, a recording and highlights can be shared in the form of a SharePoint news post.
- Event Q&A can take place in a Yammer community, so people who couldn’t attend can still benefit from the information shared.
- Promoting the town hall event will be most successful by diversifying the different channels that are currently being used by your audience.

### Learn about your audience

Invest in learning what’s most important to your audience. Knowing your audience will help you determine how to effectively deliver your message, what speakers will resonate with your audience, how to moderate the town hall, and how to  structure the town hall. [Learn more about how to scope and define your audience.](audience-profile.md)
<br>


### Ensure content is accessible to everyone

Town halls are designed to reach the entire organization or large groups within it. Make sure  the event’s  target audience  has access to the tools they need to consume the content.

- Plan to record town hall events. When a live event is recorded, it will automatically be added to Microsoft Stream. Learn how to enable [autogenerate captions](/stream/portal-autogenerate-captions). The live event can also be saved to the Yammer home page. 
- If your organization operates across multiple geographic regions, make sure the time zone the event takes place in allows for most people to attend live.  
- Yammer supports live events and town halls in many languages across multiple platforms.
- Ensure attendees have mobile access to the town hall via the Yammer app or Viva Connections (link). 



### Define the town hall message

Craft a message that’s well organized, detailed, and to the point. To engage your audience and make sure the messages in the town hall are understood by everyone:
 
- Make the presentation visual. Use PowerPoint to create a visual display of your message to keep your audience connected. Organizations have the option of [broadcasting a live event in Yammer using Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/broadcast-a-live-event-in-classic-yammer-using-teams-333a5ea6-c73e-4717-8c53-7ea8f8de2724). Learn to [configure desktop sharing in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/configure-desktop-sharing) to display your PowerPoint deck during your town hall. (fact check)
- Provide town hall objectives to attendees beforehand. Share these objectives via email or the event SharePoint site.
- Only share the most relevant information. Ensure the most important information is highlighted to reserve time and to keep your audience engaged. 


### Decide the live event speakers and structure  

Invite speakers who align with the message of the town hall. If the intent of your event is to report on  quarterly earnings,  recruit people from the finance department who can speak to insights and answer questions.  

- Develop the schedule and time limits for the town hall.
- Assign roles to moderators and brief them on key tasks. If you plan to use live Q&A during the event, prepare speakers with a list of known concerns or questions. 
- Test equipment beforehand. Make sure each speaker and moderator knows  how to use the tools used to  conduct the town hall. This can range from how to share their screen,  access the Q&A box,locate incoming comments, and [more](https://support.microsoft.com/office/drive-engagement-in-a-classic-yammer-live-event-c0244ad8-6dcb-419c-add9-2e4a00543412?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).  

### Review Microsoft 365 town hall tools 

Conduct a scalable town hall that engages your audience before, during, and after your event with Microsoft 365 tools.

### Use Yammer to host your town hall event

Yammer enables people to connect with each other across an entire organization. It helps unite people who don’t often interact and gives them the ability to discover content and meet and engage with organization leaders. Get started with [organizing live events in Yammer](https://teamworktools.azurewebsites.net/yammer/How%20to%20host%20a%20live%20event%20in%20Yammer%20Playbook.pdf) 
 

>[!NOTE]
>To host a live event in Yammer, your organization must have **Enforce Office 365 identity** selected, and you must be using Microsoft 365 connected Yammer groups. For more information, see [Enforce Office 365 identity for Yammer users](/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/enforce-office-365-identity) and [Yammer and Microsoft 365 groups](/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-and-office-365-groups).






## Promote the town hall and manage engagement

Promote the town hall before the event date where your target audience usually gets announcements and updates. Then [manage engagement during the during the town hall](#host-a-town-hall-in-yammer) and [after the town hall.](#post-event-engagement)

**Promote in Yammer**

![Image of the Yammer homepage for a community](media/th4.png)

Drive pre-event awareness in Yammer. When holding a town hall in Yammer, audience engagement begins as soon as the event has been created. Attendees can promote and discover the upcoming event through the event banner (when in the live feed), event notifications, and by accessing the Event tab on mobile.

In the Yammer Home Feed, attendees can set up notifications that let them know when the event is live. An Event banner appears when the event is live, allowing them to attend the town hall immediately from anywhere. 

**Promote in SharePoint**

![Image of event planning page in SharePoint](media/th13.png)

Inform and prepare your audience for your event by creating a [SharePoint communications site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/plan-your-sharepoint-communication-site-35d9adfe-d5cc-462f-a63a-bae7f2529182)  using the [Events template](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-event-planning-site-template-9464fe53-c85c-4e3b-94d9-0e70a45b08c6). Include instructions for attending and any other necessary top-of-mind items.

**Promote in Outlook**

Invite all attendees to the event with a calendar invite via email in Outlook. Provide detailed information such as a link to the SharePoint event site, the Yammer meeting link, and the Yammer event page. 

Include objectives or talking points in the invite as well. This will help attendees prepare questions to ask during the event.

Yammer live events are also integrated with Outlook so that event organizers can add other event stakeholders. 


**Promote in Viva Connections**

![Image of the Viva Connections homepage](media/th7.png)![Image of the Yammer homepage](media/th14.png)

Viva Connections is a digital platform built on the existing capabilities of Microsoft 365. It allows organizations to customize employee experiences and gain access to the most important information, tools, and resources on both desktop and mobile devices.

The Viva Connections home page features a feed and dashboard you can use to promote your event. Learn more about [Viva Connections](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/connections).  By publishing news posts in SharePoint to promote your event, users will learn about it wherever the Viva Connections Feed is available in your organization.

### Host a town hall in Yammer

#### Step 1: Get set up in Yammer

Creating and producing live events in Yammer requires Microsoft Stream and/ or Teams licenses and specific permissions. Yammer administrators can schedule live meetings in Yammer.  
For events using an external app or device, you will need to have your Microsoft Stream license enabled.

Learn more about [Permissions for scheduling, creating, and producing live events in Yammer](/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-live-events).

#### Step 2: Test Equipment

Determine whether your speakers will be broadcasting from a web cam or a studio-produced broadcast.  Make sure all equipment needed to connect video and audio is secured and in place.  
 
Learn more about [producing a live event in Yammer using an external device](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-and-produce-a-live-event-in-new-yammer-using-an-external-app-or-device-975f596a-8fc5-4400-8bf5-7ec77ec18415). 

#### Step 3: Manage Engagement

Audience members and moderators can engage during the event using the conversation bar. Be sure to record the event so people who weren’t able to attend live can watch later. 

![Image of the mobile Yammer homepage](media/th9.png)   ![Image of the desktop Yammer homepage](media/th10.png)

Yammer allows for a live Q&A during the event, as well as freeform conversation that promotes candid, organization-wide conversation. 

Learn more about [using Q&A in a Yammer community](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-questions-and-answers-in-a-yammer-community-a4f1b722-d1bf-42be-a592-7288c7c0b895).  




## Post-event engagement

### Share a recording of the live event

Members of your organization can watch the recording of the event stream after the event. Communities created in Yammer during the event can continue the conversation and watch the recording of the town hall on the Yammer platform. Moderators can also provide automatic recaps for those who may have missed the town hall.

Make your town hall and post-event engagement scalable by sharing your town hall recording across multiple platforms. Add it to your SharePoint site using the [Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da) or the [News feed web part](/yammer/integrate-yammer-with-other-apps/yammer-and-newsfeed), add it to your news feed in [Viva Connections](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview), or share it to a team channel in [Teams](/microsoftteams/best-practices-large-groups).


[Stream](/stream/portal-get-started) (on SharePoint) provides [Multi-Geo support](/microsoft-365/enterprise/administering-a-multi-geo-environment?view=o365-worldwide) for video storage and advanced sharing options. Increase your event recording’s discoverability and shareability by adding it to your organization’s Stream portal.

Access additional video analytics including views over time and viewer engagement by saving your town hall recording to Stream.  

### Measure attendee insights
