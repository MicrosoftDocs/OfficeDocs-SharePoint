### Build an intelligent intranet
Learn how to move through the [process of creating an intranet](https://aka.ms/IntelligentIntranet) for your organization. Get familiar with [common intranet planning and creation roles](./intranet-roles-tasks.md), design stages, and the [intranet lifecycle](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SharePoint/raw/public/SharePoint/SharePointOnline/spodownloads/Intranet%20lifecycle.pdf). Learn how to align goals into priority scenarios that you can [get started implementing](https://aka.ms/Implement-Intranet) quickly. Then, learn how to [engage with viewers](https://aka.ms/Engage-Intranet) and maintain your intranet over time as the organization changes and scales. 

### Help your organization engage and inform

Use SharePoint and other Microsoft 365 products to create communication channels that serve specific audiences. Learn how to [create and share organizational news](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7) and [use the News web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165) into key landing pages and portals.

Integrate [Viva Engage](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-yammer-47526868-b136-40cc-a80d-c870eadd9ba5) and the [Viva Engage web parts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da) to embed conversations and highlights in sites. Use the power of video to [share pre-recorded messages](/stream/portal-upload-video) and [record organizational events](/stream/live-event-overview) for later viewing. Use content services like [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-content-to-a-specific-audience-on-a-sharepoint-site-68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to make sure key audience are targeted specific content. 

### Enhance collaboration and sharing

Create and increase opportunities to collaborate across your organization. Use [Microsoft Lists](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f) and [document libraries](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-libraries-7d4221d9-8fb9-40d5-8441-2374c84b5e26) to securely store and dynamically display content that can be accessed on any device. Then, users can view, share, and [coauthor content](https://support.microsoft.com/office/document-collaboration-and-co-authoring-ee1509b4-1f6e-401e-b04a-782d26f564a4) in real time.

Use [SharePoint team sites](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-a-sharepoint-team-site-75545757-36c3-46a7-beed-0aaa74f0401e) to create secure collaboration spaces for teams to share content, get updates, and news. Consider [adding Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-microsoft-team-from-sharepoint-545973b6-c38f-426a-b2b6-16405a561628) to your team site to add real-time chat and virtual meetings.

### Achieve specific outcomes

Use SharePoint to achieve specific business outcomes like narrowing the distance between leadership teams and individual contributors by [creating a leadership site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-a-leadership-site-for-your-organization-e4a984db-d277-45ab-b18e-fa117b25bb4d) that encourages sharing news and starting conversations. Use SharePoint to unite and inform groups of people with related interests by [setting up news](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-setting-up-news-for-your-organization-using-a-hub-site-95a90834-96a2-463c-b741-31c4d2230706) for a hub site. View custom solutions in the [look book](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/8f8337d2-b1f6-4a84-91a4-9081f841f0f6) to help inspire your next site design or get help with [new employee onboarding](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/75e60a32-9849-4ed4-b83e-b2b08983ad19), [crisis communication](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/8f8337d2-b1f6-4a84-91a4-9081f841f0f6), and more.

### 2 - Understand and align 

[Get started planning](./plan-intranet.md) your intelligent intranet. Learn more about [intranet governance](./intranet-governance.md) before you start building and ensure you have a plan in place to manage intranet governance.

### 3 - Implement plans and start building

Start building [the home site](./home-site.md), [hubs](./planning-hub-sites.md), [sites](https://support.microsoft.com/office/plan-your-sharepoint-communication-site-35d9adfe-d5cc-462f-a63a-bae7f2529182), and pages that will make up the framework of your intranet.  Consider using Microsoft Purview Information Barriers to ensure [confidential content](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers-sharepoint) is seen by the right users or use [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-content-to-a-specific-audience-on-a-sharepoint-site-68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to target specific content to certain groups of users.

### 4 - Engage and manage

Measure intranet effectiveness by reviewing [Microsoft 365 usage analytics](/microsoft-365/admin/usage-analytics/usage-analytics) and [SharePoint hub and page usage analytics](https://support.microsoft.com/office/view-usage-data-for-your-sharepoint-site-2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e).
