# Introduction to SharePoint in Microsoft 365

Microsoft SharePoint is a cloud-based service that helps organizations share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to: 

- Empower teamwork
- Quickly find information
- Seamlessly collaborate across the organization
  
The resources on this page are designed to get you started. Depending on the needs of your organization, you may want to read about [migration](#migration) and [governance](#governance) options before you start rolling SharePoint out to your users. If you're ready to get started with SharePoint, read about [collaboration](#collaboration) options and how to create a [modern intelligent intranet](#modern-intranet). As you roll out SharePoint to your organization, remember to [train your users](#training) to help them get the most out of these tools.

If you're just starting out with SharePoint, learn about the [FastTrack onboarding and adoption services](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/office), [find a SharePoint certified partner](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/sharepoint-partners-sharepoint-support), or [visit the SharePoint community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint/ct-p/SharePoint).

Once you're using SharePoint, get the [OneDrive sync app](https://onedrive.live.com/about/download) and the [mobile app](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/mobile-app).
