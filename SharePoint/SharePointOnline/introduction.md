# Introduction to SharePoint and OneDrive in Microsoft 365

SharePoint and OneDrive in Microsoft 365 are cloud-based services that help organizations share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to: 

- Empower teamwork
- Quickly find information
- Seamlessly collaborate across the organization

The resources on this page are designed to get you started. Depending on the needs of your organization, you may want to read about [migration](#migration) and [governance](#governance) options before you start rolling SharePoint and OneDrive out to your users. 

If you're ready to get started with SharePoint and OneDrive, read [Plan for SharePoint and OneDrive in Microsoft 365](plan-for-sharepoint-onedrive.md) and follow the planning and rollout articles that are listed in that article.

If you're just starting out with SharePoint and OneDrive, learn about the [FastTrack onboarding and adoption services](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/office), [find a SharePoint certified partner](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/sharepoint-partners-sharepoint-support), or [visit the SharePoint community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint/ct-p/SharePoint).

Once you're using SharePoint and OneDrive, get the [OneDrive sync app](https://onedrive.live.com/about/download) and the [mobile app](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/mobile-app).
