# Leadership connection: Use Microsoft 365 to connect leaders and teams

Microsoft 365 can help your organization's leadership teams connect with employees to build community around a common purpose and goal. Learn how to create a culture and internal place to help engage and connect leadership teams with the rest of your organization.



**Help unite your organization by:**

- Creating a sustainable, two-way dialogue between leadership and the rest of the organization by removing communication barriers
- Hosting organizational or department-wide meetings with live Q&A sessions so everyone is up-to-speed on leadership initiatives
- Sharing relevant news, ideas, and updates to encourage employees to engage and network with leadership teams
- Using analytics to gain insights on engagement and understand the impact of activities
- Bringing elements of the experience together using Viva Connections

## Plan your leadership connection strategy
Start by making sure you understand your audience's needs and preferences. Review [how to profile and scope your audience](audience-profile.md). This scenario will have the most successful outcome when multiple communication methods are combined. Start with a SharePoint communication site and a Yammer channel that connects the organization with leadership. Then, plan and host a live event that is recorded and shared with others. Finally, bring all these communication elements together into an engaging mobile experience using Viva Connections.

![Diagram of the components that make up the leadership connection solution.](media/step-leadership-1.png)

- **1. SharePoint communication site** - Create a SharePoint communication site that houses all things leadership â€“ everything from news and announcements to events, people profiles and networking opportunities. [Use the Leadership connection site template.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-leadership-connection-site-template-a2996d9f-c08e-4de6-8696-a7de323c8add)
- **2. Yammer community** - [Use Yammer](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-and-create-a-community-in-yammer-56aaf591-1fbc-4160-ba26-0c4723c23fd6) to instantly connect, ask questions, and share ideas with the leadership team. Then, [use the Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-and-create-a-community-in-yammer-56aaf591-1fbc-4160-ba26-0c4723c23fd6) to embed the conversation on the leadership connection SharePoint site.
- **3. Yammer live events** - Use the [Yammer community for live events](/stream/live-event-m365#live-events-and-microsoft-365) and questions and answers.
- **4. Viva Connections** - Bring the SharePoint site and Yammer conversation into one place where users can catch up and connect with leaders in the Microsoft Teams mobile app. [Learn more about Viva Connections](guide-to-setting-up-viva-connections.md).

### Planning considerations

- Multiple communication solutions can be combined to provide opportunities across the organization to connect with leadership regardless of worksite location or time zone.
- Create opportunities outside of a live event to allow everyone within the organization to connect, network, and learn from leadership teams.
- Develop communication channels that collect feedback and questions for the leadership team, and save responses for the next live event.
- Create a practice of recording live events that can be shared and viewed later.
- Build durable communication methods that do not require organized events to generate content.
- Identify other opportunities across the organization to spread awareness about the leadership connection initiative such as new. employee orientation, regular communications to networking groups, and promotion in employee resource groups.

## Build your communication strategy
Start by creating or using an existing SharePoint communication site. Then connect a new or existing Yammer community to the SharePoint site using the Yammer conversations web part. Then, plan and host live events, share the recordings on the leadership site, and keep the conversation going in Yammer channels.

## Step 1: Create a SharePoint leadership site
SharePoint communication sites are a great tool to create a landing place to share leadership news, initiatives, and opportunities to network and connect. This is an ideal opportunity to use the [Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da) on the home page to connect to an existing Yammer community that connects leadership team members with the rest of the organization. Use the [Events web part](https://support.microsoft.com/\office/use-the-events-web-part-5fe4da93-5fa9-4695-b1ee-b0ae4c981909) to post and [target leadership events to specific audiences](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-navigation-news-and-files-to-specific-audiences-33d84cb6-14ed-4e53-a426-74c38ea32293).

#### Get started creating your SharePoint leadership site
There are several resources that can help you quickly create a leadership site:

- Use a SharePoint site template provided by Microsoft. [Apply the Leadership connection template](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-leadership-connection-site-template-a2996d9f-c08e-4de6-8696-a7de323c8add), then customize the site to for the needs of your organization.
- Create your own leadership site following [step-by-step instructions in this guided walkthrough](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-a-leadership-site-for-your-organization-e4a984db-d277-45ab-b18e-fa117b25bb4d).
- Use the Leadership connection template in the SharePoint look book. The [SharePoint look book Leadership connection template](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/c19f437b-35ca-42f2-b27a-1caa49ad8bde) requires the use of [SharePoint PowerShell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true) and administrative credentials.

#### Publish news from the leadership site
Once your leadership site has been created and shared with the right audiences, you can [publish news from this site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7). Then, use the [News web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165) on the home page to display leadership news and [target leadership news to specific audiences](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-navigation-news-and-files-to-specific-audiences-33d84cb6-14ed-4e53-a426-74c38ea32293). Other sites across your organization can customize the settings in the News web part to pull news from an organizational news site. Consider cross promoting leadership news on the home site, on a new employee onboarding site, and where other leadership-oriented news can be found.

#### Monitor usage analytics for your SharePoint site
As a SharePoint site owner, you can view information about how users interact with your site. For example, you can view the number of people who have visited the site, how many times people have visited the site, and a list of files that have received the most views. Learn more about how to [access usage data for your leadership site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/view-usage-data-for-your-sharepoint-site-2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e).

## Step 2: Create a leadership community in Yammer
Communities in Yammer help employees share knowledge, engage with others in the employee experience, and provide a social platform for company-wide communications. It can also be used to drive leadership engagement by providing a central place for your conversations, documents, events, and updates. Yammer can help you host a live event with [moderated Q&A](https://support.microsoft.com/office/drive-engagement-in-a-classic-yammer-live-event-c0244ad8-6dcb-419c-add9-2e4a00543412) for up to 10,000 attendees.

![Screenshot of the leadership connection Yammer community.](media/lc-yammer-community.png)

**Use Yammer to help engage your organization by:**

- Engaging employees in the goals and vision of the company
- Informing employees about strategic initiatives and important updates
- Showing employees that their feedback is being heard by senior leadership

If your organization doesn't already have a Yammer community that includes members of the leadership team, start by [creating a new Yammer community](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-and-create-a-community-in-yammer-56aaf591-1fbc-4160-ba26-0c4723c23fd6). Then, [use the Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da) to embed conversations or highlights from existing Yammer communities on the SharePoint site.

Help [onboard your organization to Yammer](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8D13E85F1CF91770!237&ithint=file%2cdocx&authkey=!AMh1sXi46TE875I) and help others understand [how to use Yammer](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8D13E85F1CF91770!254&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!ACrN15bnGCy_ZTs).

#### Monitor conversations and engagement insights

## Step 3: Host a live leadership event in Yammer with Q&A
Create and produce live events for people in the leadership Yammer network, with built-in discussions for use before, during, and after the event. Up to 10,000 people can attend at once from anywhere on their device or computer (higher limits for event attendees are temporarily available through the [Microsoft 365 Live Events Assistance program](/stream/live-events-assistance). Make the video available after the event on the leadership site, so that people who can't make it at the scheduled time can still participate.

**Image of live questions and answers during an event**

![Screenshot of a woman presenting in a live event in Teams.](media/lc-event-questions.png)

There are two ways [live events in Yammer can be produced](/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-live-events#types-of-live-events). The requirements depend on which video production methods you intend to use in your organization. Learn more about which method of live event you should use. For live events that only require visual and audio support, consider [hosting a live event using Yammer in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-and-produce-a-live-event-in-new-yammer-using-teams-d891bff6-eda2-493f-8b0d-d87932e7937d).

Once you've determined the right method for your live event, get started organizing and scheduling the event.

![Diagram of how to plan a live event with questions and answers.](media/lc-event-plan-2.png)

Learn more about [how to organize the live event in Yammer](https://support.microsoft.com/office/organize-a-live-event-in-new-yammer-7338782a-4f0b-4fd0-a6c3-33625906ead1). Review the [Yammer live event playbook](https://support.office.com/article/organize-a-live-event-in-yammer-105dd7af-9caf-4a5e-8a44-56d203e96551) and [Yammer live event FAQs](https://support.microsoft.com/office/new-yammer-live-event-faq-ec9deff2-3181-4300-a204-c809729e4dff) to understand all the different roles and responsibilities, how to ensure the event goes smoothly, and how to drive engagement. Consider using guidance from [How to host a town hall for your organization](hold-town-hall-using-yammer.md) to plan your live event.

### Insights and engagement metrics for live events
Before the event starts, you will have access to a dashboard that will help you understand event reach, engagement during the event, top conversations, and more. Insights are only available to event organizers and producers. Learn more about [how to view live event data](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-insights-about-live-events-in-yammer-2ce5e236-8b72-4715-88ea-a8e15d9488ba) and use insights to host powerful live events.

## Step 4: Expand your reach and engagement using Viva Connections
Bring the SharePoint leadership site, news, and conversations from the Yammer community into one central place in Microsoft Teams using [Viva Connections](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview). Viva Connections creates an opportunity to push specific content and display popular resources by combining the power of your SharePoint intranet with Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 apps like Yammer and Stream.
