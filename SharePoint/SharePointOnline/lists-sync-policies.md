# Use Group Policy to control Lists sync settings

This article describes the Group Policy objects (GPOs) for Microsoft Lists (and SharePoint lists) that admins can configure by using Group Policy. Use the registry key info to confirm that a setting is enabled. Lists sync policies are listed under OneDrive because Lists sync gets packaged, installed, and updated through the OneDrive sync app’s existing update mechanism.

## List of policies by string ID

- (DisableNucleusSync) [Prevent Lists sync from running on the device](lists-sync-policies.md#prevent-lists-sync-from-running-on-the-device)

- (BlockExternalListSync) [Prevent users from syncing lists shared from other organizations](lists-sync-policies.md#prevent-users-from-syncing-lists-shared-from-other-organizations)

- (DisableNucleusSilentConfig) [Prevent users from getting silently signed in to Lists sync with their Windows credentials](lists-sync-policies.md#prevent-users-from-getting-silently-signed-in-to-lists-sync-with-their-windows-credentials)

### Prevent Lists sync from running on the device

By default, Lists sync is turned on for users of Microsoft Lists. If you enable this policy, Lists sync will be blocked from running on the device.

Prevent Lists sync from running on the device:

`[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive] "DisableNucleusSync" = "dword:1"`

Re-enable Lists sync on the device:

`[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive] "DisableNucleusSync" = "dword:0"`

### Prevent users from syncing lists shared from other organizations

Enabling this setting prevents users at your organization from syncing lists that are shared from other organizations. After the setting is enabled (value 1) on a computer, lists shared from other organizations won't sync. Disable the setting (value 0) to allow your users to sync external lists.

Prevent external List sync with:

`[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive] "BlockExternalListSync" = "dword:1`

Restore external List sync with:

`[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive] "BlockExternalListSync" = "dword:0"`

### Prevent users from getting silently signed in to Lists sync with their Windows credentials

Lists sync is set up to automatically sign users in with their Windows account credentials. If you enable this setting, people who used Microsoft Lists previously and who are signed in on an Azure AD-joined PC will no longer be able to set up Lists sync without entering their account credentials.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the [Office browser extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/office/gggmmkjegpiggikcnhidnjjhmicpibll?source=sfw) isn't installed on users’ Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Chrome, etc.), we strongly recommend leaving silent account configuration enabled to ensure the seamless operation of List sync via Microsoft.SharePoint.exe.  

Enabling this policy sets the following registry key value to 1:

`[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive] "DisableNucleusSilentConfig" = "dword:00000001"`

For more info about this feature, including troubleshooting steps, see [Silently configure user accounts](/onedrive/use-silent-account-configuration).

## Control Lists sync on unmanaged devices and based on location  

You can use the following settings to control access to Lists sync from unmanaged devices and configure network location-based access to List sync.

[Control access from unmanaged devices](control-access-from-unmanaged-devices.md)

[Control access to SharePoint and OneDrive based on network location](control-access-based-on-network-location.md)
