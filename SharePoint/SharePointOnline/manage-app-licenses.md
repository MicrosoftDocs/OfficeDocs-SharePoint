# Manage app licenses for a SharePoint environment

Apps in the [SharePoint Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=sharepoint) are no longer licensed through SharePoint. The Manage Licenses page in the classic SharePoint admin center no longer has any effect.

Each app in the SharePoint Store may have its own licensing requirements and payment model as specified by the app developer.
