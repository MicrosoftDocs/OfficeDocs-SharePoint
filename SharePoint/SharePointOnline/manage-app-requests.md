# Manage app requests

When users request an app, they are requesting that an admin get that app on their behalf. In an app request, users can request a specific number of licenses, and they can provide a business justification for why they need the app. App requests are saved to the App Requests list in the Apps site.

To manage app requests
1. Go to the [More features page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=classicfeatures&modern=true), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) for your organization.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have Office 365 Germany, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page.
   > 
   > If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page.

1. Under **Apps**, select **Open**, and then select **More features**.

1. Select **Configure store settings**.

1. Expand **App Requests**, and then select **Pending**.

1. On the app request form, add any comments in the **Comments** field.
    
1. Select **Approve and add this app**.

1. Confirm the data access required by the app by selecting **Confirm**.

1. If the app requires additional permissions, go to the API access page to approve those permissions.

1. Close the panel.

To decline an app    
1. In the **App Requests** list, select a request.
    
1. On the app request form, add any comments in the **Comments** field.
    
1. Select **Decline request**.

1. On the confirmation panel, select **Decline request**.

If you didn't add the app to all sites in the approval process, users need to add it to the site. See [Add an app to a site](https://support.office.com/article/dd98e50e-d3db-4ecb-9bb7-82b189822d43).
    
Site users who request apps can view their requests by going to **Settings** \> **Add an app** \> **Your Requests**.
