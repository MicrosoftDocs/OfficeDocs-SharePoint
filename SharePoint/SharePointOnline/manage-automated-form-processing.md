# Manage automated document processing

Admins can show or hide [automated document processing options in SharePoint document libraries](https://support.office.com/article/form-processing-in-sharepoint-cecf236f-224d-4630-9082-b5c79e0cd59a) through the admin center. 


* If [AI Builder](/ai-builder/overview) document processing is not enabled, the freeform selection method and layout method will not be visible to users on the **Options for model creation** page.
* Creating a [document processing AI model](/ai-builder/form-processing-model-overview) from SharePoint applies the model to the library it was created in. 
 
  * You no longer need to configure the flows to process existing files.
  * The information will be available in the values of the columns in the library. 
* The [default environment for the Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview#the-default-environment) will be used for all document processing models built through these options.
