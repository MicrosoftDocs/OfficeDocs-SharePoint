# Manage search dictionaries

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../SharePointServer/includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

In SharePoint Server, you can use search dictionaries to include or exclude company names to be extracted from the contents of your indexed documents, or you can include or exclude words for query spelling correction.
  
## Manage company name extraction
<a name="__toc342653321"> </a>

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning on November 15th, 2019, we'll be removing Company Name Extraction from SharePoint in Microsoft 365. This will only impact you if you have configured company name extraction to be surfaced in the classic Enterprise Search Center as a refiner. Learn more about the specifics and other options by reading [Changes to company name extraction in SharePoint](changes-to-company-name-extraction-in-sharepoint-online.md).

For company name extraction to work, that is, for a company name to be pulled from your content and for it to be mapped to the managed property **companies**, you have to make sure that:
  
- The managed property setting **Company name extraction** is enabled on the managed property that you want to extract company names from. This setting is available for the managed properties **Title**, **Body** and **Notes**. See also [Manage the search schema in SharePoint](manage-search-schema.md).
    
- The name of the company that you want to extract is in the prepopulated company name dictionary or in the **Company Inclusions** list. 
    
After you have done this, you can then use the managed property **companies** to create refiners based on the extracted company name in the **Refinement Web** **Part**, on the search results page.

## Manage query spelling correction
<a name="__toc342653324"> </a>

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning on December 8, 2020, we'll be removing Query Spelling Inclusions and Query Spelling Exclusions from SharePoint in Microsoft 365. This will only impact you if you have configured Query Spelling Suggestions.

If you or another user enters a word in a search query that appears to be misspelled, the search results page helps you out by displaying query spelling corrections. This is also known as "Did you mean?".
  
For example, if you enter a query that contains the word "ampitheater", the query spelling correction would show "amphitheater" if this term is available in many places in your indexed documents. You can add terms such as the one just shown to the **Query Spelling Inclusions** list, or to the **Query Spelling Exclusions** list to influence how you want query spelling corrections to be applied or not. It takes up to 10 minutes for any changes to the **Query Spelling Inclusions** or the **Query Spelling Exclusions** list to take effect.
