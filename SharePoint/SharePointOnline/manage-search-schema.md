# Manage the search schema in SharePoint Online

The search schema controls what users can search for, how users can search it, and how you can present the results on your search websites. By changing the search schema, you can customize the search experience in SharePoint Online.
  
## About the search schema
<a name="__toc351360836"> </a>

When a user searches for content on SharePoint sites, search only finds what's in the **search index**, and only shows results that the user has permission to see. 
  
Search discovers information by crawling items on your site. The discovered content and metadata are called **properties** of the item. The **search schema** has a list of **crawled properties** that helps the crawler decide what content and metadata to extract. 
  
Not all crawled content or metadata is useful to have in the search index, so the search schema has a list of useful types of content and metadata, called **managed properties**. The index only includes content and metadata from the managed properties. Examples of useful metadata for the index are the author and the title of a document. 
  
Search comes with relevant crawled properties mapped to managed properties. For example, crawled properties related to author map to a managed property related to author. If you add a managed property, you must map it to a crawled property to get content into the index. After the site, library, or list has been crawled, users can search for the content and metadata of new, or changed managed properties. See [Introducing Search Schema for SharePoint]() for more info.

> [!NOTE]
> Numeric data in Microsoft Excel files isn't indexed. For example, the number "123456789" isn't indexed, but the string "PO123456789" is indexed. 
  
### Managed properties and search
<a name="__toc351360837"> </a>

Each managed property has settings that determine how users can search for the content of that managed property, and how the content can be shown in the search results.
  
You can create new, **custom** managed properties, but these can only contain text or Yes/No. If you need other content types in your custom managed property, then use one of the unused, **built-in** managed properties that search comes with. These managed properties can contain information in integer, decimal, date and time, double precision float, or binary format. You can "rename" these unused managed properties by using the alias setting. 
  
For the built-in managed properties, you can change their mappings to crawled properties, but the only setting you can change is the alias.
  
 **Define which content that users can search and get results for**
  
If you set a managed property to be **searchable**, the content is added to the index. This means that a simple query for "Smith" returns items that contain the word "Smith" and also items whose "author" property contains "Smith". If you want users to be able to "only search for items that have this specific author", set the author property to be **queryable**. Then, to find only items that have an author named Smith, users can query for "author:Smith". 
  
If you want to prevent the content in a managed property from showing up as search results, you can disable the **retrievable** setting for the managed property. 
  
If you don't want anonymous users to see the information in a managed property, for example who has authored an item, disable the "Safe for Anonymous" setting for the managed property.
  
 **Get better search results when you have multi-lingual content and metadata with special characters**
  
When search indexes content or when it processes queries, it breaks a stream of text into smaller parts such as words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements. These parts are called tokens. When users enter a query, search tries to find tokens in the index that match the tokens of the query.
  
For most languages, search changes text to lower-case, removes diacritics, replaces special characters, such as punctuation, with white space, and then breaks on white spaces.
  
Breaking on white spaces works fine for a language like English, but not so well for East Asian languages. Let's say you have a document library that contains product datasheets both in English and Chinese. Each datasheet has a product identifier with non-alphanumerical characters, such as "11.132-84-115#4". When search processes the datasheet, it **detects** its language, and tokenizes everything in it according to that language. So, the product identifier in a Chinese data sheet is tokenized as if it was Chinese text, and in an English data sheet the product identifier is tokenized as if it was English text. When users search for a product identifier, search tokenizes their query according to the language setting of the SharePoint site they're on. If the site is set to English, and the user searches for a product identifier that was tokenized as Chinese text, the tokens might not match, and the users get no results. 
  
Here's how you can make results better for users: When search crawls the datasheet, it extracts the product identifier. Map the crawled property for the product identifier to a new managed property, "ProductID". Enable **language neutral tokenization** for the "ProductID" managed property, and instruct users to search for product identifiers against the "ProductID"managed property, like this:  *ProductID:"11.132-8"*  . Because you've enabled language neutral tokenization for "ProductID", search uses language neutral tokenization for the query and can find matching results for the query. 
  
 **Get better search results when you have metadata with special characters**
  
To help users get better search results when they search in managed properties that contain metadata with non-alphanumeric characters, you can enable the **finer tokenization** setting for the managed property. 
  
Let's look at the example with a product datasheet library again.
  
Users who prefer to quickly enter a query and then browse the results to find the datasheet they're looking for, typically enter queries like ProductID:"132-884". Because search breaks content for the **search index** into smaller parts than it does for **queries**, search might not find matches for these queries. When the query is tokenized finer, it's more likely that there are matches between the tokens in the search index and in the query. Users can also query for the middle or last part of the product identifier. 
  
Users who search for a datasheet and expect to only get results that match the full product identifier, typically write queries like  *ProductID:"11.132-884-115#4"*  . Finer query tokenization doesn't make a difference for such queries. 
  
 **Determine which title to show in results**
  
A single crawled property can be mapped to multiple managed properties. Or, multiple crawled properties can be mapped to a single managed property, for example both the "Writer" and "Author" crawled properties can be mapped to the "Author" managed property.
  
For example, a document in a library can have a SharePoint title, a title in the file metadata, and the content can have a title formatted with the style "Title". All these are mapped to the "Title" managed property. It's the title from the crawled property that's highest on the mapping list and that has a value that's included in the index.
  
 **Auto-generated managed properties**
  
Some managed properties are generated automatically. One example is when you add a site column to a SharePoint library or list. When search crawls that list it automatically generates a crawled and a managed property for the site column, and a mapping between them. Another example is when crawling finds metadata in a document you've uploaded to SharePoint. If there isn't already a mapping to a managed property for that metadata, such as 'Title', search auto-generates a managed property. The type of crawled property determines the settings of the auto-generated managed property.
  
The search schema displays the name of auto-generated managed properties and their mappings to crawled properties in grey in the search schema. The search schema doesn't hold the settings of the managed auto-generated managed properties. The settings exist, but they're hidden from the search schema. You can add mappings to other managed properties for the crawled properties, but if you change any other setting, you override the other (hidden) settings and the auto-generated managed property is converted to a regular managed property. If you decide to **change** an auto-generated managed property, review **all** the settings carefully, just as you would when you create a new property manually.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Auto-generated managed properties are case-sensitive. When accessing auto-generated managed properties, such as through a REST query, verify the casing is correct. If the casing is incorrect, no value will be returned.
  
### Refine on managed properties
<a name="__toc351360838"> </a>

If you want to use a managed property as a refiner on the search results page, use the setting **refinable**. This setting is only available on the built-in managed properties, and only [affects the classic search experience](differences-classic-modern-search.md). If you need to use a new managed property, or an auto-generated managed property, as a refiner, rename an existing, unused managed property (that's refinable) by using an alias. There are quite a few managed properties available for this purpose. They have names such as "RefinableString00" and "RefinableDate19." 
  
For example, you create a new site column called "NewColors", and you want users to be able to use "NewColors" as an option when they refine on the search results. In the search schema, you choose an unused managed property, for example "RefinableString00", and rename the property to "NewColors" by using the Alias setting. Then, you map this new managed property to the relevant crawled property.
  
### Change the search schema on tenant level or on site collection level
<a name="__toc351360839"> </a>

Usually, you don't have to change the default search schema for the tenant unless you want to create a more advanced or customized search experience.
  
You can change the search schema for the whole tenant or for a specific site collection only. The search schema for the site collection is based on the search schema for the tenant, so typically, you would make changes on the tenant level first, and then on the site collection level. Any changes you make on a site collection, only apply to that site collection.
  
### Crawling and re-indexing
<a name="__toc351360840"> </a>

When you change managed properties or add new ones, the changes take effect only after the content has been re-crawled. In SharePoint Online, crawling happens automatically based on the defined crawl schedule.
  
When you have added a new property to a list or to a library, or when you have changed properties that are used in a list or library, search has to re-crawl the content before your changes will be reflected in the search index. Because your changes are made in the search schema, and not to the actual site, the search will not automatically re-crawl the list or the library. To make sure that your changes are crawled, you can specifically request a re-indexing of the list or library. When you do this, the list or library content will be re-crawled so that you can start using your new managed properties in queries, query rules and display templates.
  
### Managed properties and Delve
<a name="__toc351360840"> </a>

Delve uses managed properties to query the Office graph and to display content cards in Delve. For example, you can see managed properties like Author, Filename, ModifiedBy and LastModifiedTime on the Delve content cards.
  
Any document that a user can view or edit in Office 365, can also appear in Delve. Delve doesn't change any permissions and users will only see documents they already have access to. Sometimes, though, you may want to prevent a document from appearing in Delve.
  
You can use the HideFromDelve managed property to hide a document from Delve. You can keep storing the document in Office 365, and people can still find it through search - it just won't show up in Delve anymore. See [Hide documents from Delve](manage-search-schema.md#BKMK_HideFromDelveSteps).
  
For more information about Delve, see [Office Delve for Office 365 admins](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=733496)
  
## Create a new managed property
<a name="__toc351360841"> </a>

> [!NOTE]
> Not all options are available in SharePoint Online.

> [!NOTE]
> Refinable Managed Properties cannot be created. Instead use the existing Refinable Managed Properties, e.g. RefinableString00 or RefinableInt00. Searching "Refinable" will show all of the usable Refinable Managed Properties available.

In SharePoint Online, when you create a new managed property, it will have some limitations. For example, the property can only be of type **Text** or **Yes/No**, and it can't be refinable or sortable.
  
If you need a property of a different type, or one that has different characteristics than what is available, follow the steps under [Create a managed property by renaming an existing one](manage-search-schema.md#__ref341260321).
  
1. To go to the Search Schema page either for the Tenant or a Site collection:
    
    **Go to the Search Schema page for the Tenant**
    
1. Sign in to the Office 365.
    
2. Click **Admin** and then click **SharePoint**. You're now in the SharePoint admin center.
    
3. Click **search**, and then click **Manage Search Schema** on the search administration page. 
    
    **Go to the Search Schema page for a site collection**
    
1. On your site, go to **Settings**![Office 365 Settings button](media/a9a59c0f-2e67-4cbf-9438-af273b0d552b.png), and then click **Site settings**.
    
2. Click **Search Schema** under **Site Collection Administration**.
    
2. Click **Managed Properties**.
    
3. Click **New Managed Property** on the **Managed Properties** page. 
    
4. type the name of the new managed property in the **Property name** box in the **Name and description** section. Type a description if you want. 
    
5. In the **Type** section, select one of the available options for the property: 
    
  - Yes/No
    
  - Text
    
6. In the **Main characteristics** section, select one or several of the available options. 
    
7. In the **Mappings to crawled properties** section, click **Add a mapping**.
    
8. In the **crawled property selection** dialog box, choose a crawled property to map to the managed property, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step if you want to map more crawled properties to the same managed property.
    
9. In the **Mappings to crawled properties** section, specify if you want to include: 
    
  - All content from all crawled properties mapped to this managed property
    
  - Content from the first crawled property that contains a value and, optionally, in which order
    
10. Click **OK**.
