# SharePoint classic search administration overview

As a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, you can customize and impact the search experiences for your users. You can define searchable managed properties in the search schema, identify high-quality pages to improve relevance, manage query rules and result sources, and remove individual results. You can also evaluate any changes by viewing reports about usage and search.
  
The changes you make from the search administration page are valid for the whole tenant, but you can also customize search on site collection level and on site level.

You can customize and tailor the classic search experience more than Microsoft Search in SharePoint. Some classic search settings can impact both experiences, [learn how to avoid impacting Microsoft Search](differences-classic-modern-search.md).
