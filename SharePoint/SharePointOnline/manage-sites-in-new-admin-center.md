# Manage sites in the SharePoint admin center

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites** page</a> of the SharePoint admin center lets you view the SharePoint sites in your organization, including communication sites, channel sites, and sites that belong to Microsoft 365 groups. It also lets you [sort and filter sites](customize-admin-center-site-list.md), search for a site, and create new sites.
  
![Active sites page](media/active-sites-page.png)
  
The Active sites page lists the root website for each site collection. Subsites and the following sites aren't included.

- Sites with these URLs:
  
   |**URL**|**Description**|
   |:-----|:-----|
   |/sites/contentTypeHub |Content hub host |
   |/sites/CompliancePolicyCenter |Policy center |
   |/portal/hub |PointPublishing hub |
   |/search |Search site |
   |/personal/ |OneDrive sites |

- Sites with these templates:

   |**ID**|**Name**|**Description**|
   |:-----|:-----|:-----|
   |6000 |REVIEWCTR# |Review center |
   |10043 |FunSite# |SharePoint tenant fundamental site |
   |65 |POINTPUBLISHINGHUB# |PointPublishing hub |
   |66 |POINTPUBLISHINGPERSONAL#0 |Personal blog |
   |67 |POINTPUBLISHINGTOPIC#0 |PointPublishing topic |
   |3500 |POLICYCTR# |Compliance policy center |
   |30003 |TestSite# |Test site |
   |3 |CENTRALADMIN# |Central admin site |
   |54 |SPSMSITEHOST# |My Site host |
   |21 |SPSPERS# |SharePoint Portal Server personal space |
   |16 |TENANTADMIN# |Tenant admin site |
   |301 |REDIRECTSITE# |Redirect site |
   |70 |CSPCONTAINER# |CSP container |

Note that you may see differences between the sites in the active sites list and those listed in the [SharePoint site usage report in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/sharepoint-site-usage-ww) because the site templates and URLs listed above are included in the SharePoint site usage report.

For more info about tasks on the Active sites page, see:

- [Create a site](create-site-collection.md)
- [Register a site as a hub site](create-hub-site.md) and [Unregister a site as a hub site](remove-hub-site.md)
- [Change sharing settings for a site](change-external-sharing-site.md)

For all site types except channel sites, you can add or remove site admins and change the primary admin. For group-connected team sites, you can also add and remove group owners. Note that if you remove a person as a primary admin, they will still be listed as an additional admin. For info about each role, see [About site permissions](site-permissions.md).

1. In the [SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219), select **Sites** > **Active sites** or browse to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites** page</a>.

2. In the left column, select a site. 
    
3. Select **Membership** on the command bar to open the details panel to update the permissions of the members.
