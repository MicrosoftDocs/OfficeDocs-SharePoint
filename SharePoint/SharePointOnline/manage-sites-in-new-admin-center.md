# Manage sites in the SharePoint admin center

The <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites** page</a> of the SharePoint admin center lets you view the SharePoint sites in your organization, including communication sites, channel sites, and sites that belong to Microsoft 365 groups. It also lets you [sort and filter sites](customize-admin-center-site-list.md), search for a site, and create new sites.
  
![Active sites page](media/active-sites-page.png)
  
> [!NOTE]
> The Active sites page lists the root website for each site collection. Subsites and redirect sites (REDIRECTSITE#0) created by changing a site address or replacing the root site. <br>Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the [Targeted release option in Microsoft 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365). This means that you might not yet see some features described in this article, or they might look different. 

For more info about tasks on the Active sites page, see:

- [Create a site](create-site-collection.md)
- [Register a site as a hub site](create-hub-site.md) and [Unregister a site as a hub site](remove-hub-site.md)
- [Change sharing settings for a site](change-external-sharing-site.md)  
- [Delete a site](delete-site-collection.md)
- [Manage site storage limits](manage-site-collection-storage-limits.md)

## Add or remove site admins and group owners
<a name="addremoveadmins"> </a>

For all site types except channel sites, you can add or remove site admins and change the primary admin. For group-connected team sites, you can also add and remove group owners. Note that if you remove a person as a primary admin, they will still be listed as an additional admin. For info about each role, see [About site permissions](site-permissions.md).

1. In the SharePoint admin center, select **Sites** > **Active sites** or browse to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites** page</a>.

2. In the left column, select a site. 
    
3. Select **Permissions**. 

4. Select **Manage** for the permissions that you want to update.

5. Add or remove people or change their role, and then select **Save**.

2. In the left column, select a site. 
    
3. Select **Hub**. The options that appear depend on whether the site you selected is registered as a hub site, or associated with a hub.
