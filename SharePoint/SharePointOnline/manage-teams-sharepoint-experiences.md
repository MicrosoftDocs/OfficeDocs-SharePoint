# Manage settings and permissions when SharePoint and Teams are integrated
In this article, learn how to manage settings and permissions when Teams and SharePoint are integrated together. Learn more about [integrations between SharePoint and Teams, basic terminology, and structure.](teams-connected-sites.md)

## How to identify and navigate between SharePoint and Teams
Teams-connected sites include additional information to indicate the connection to Teams. In the SharePoint site header, you will see the Teams icon following the site logo and site title.

In the site, the **Go to channel** link is available in the command bar when viewing document libraries. For the parent site, this link redirects to Teams and the general channel for the team. For the channel sites, it links to the channel in teams.

Additionally, from teams and channels in Microsoft Teams, you can select the ellipsis (…) at the top-right of the channel and then **Open in SharePoint** to navigate to the Teams connected team site or channel site in SharePoint.

## Manage settings and permissions
When SharePoint sites and Teams are integrated, certain setting and classifications need to be managed in the [settings in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-team-settings-and-permissions-in-teams-ce053b04-1b8e-4796-baa8-90dc427b3acc). You’ll notice that when you navigate to **Settings** in SharePoint site, certain options are not editable, like **Permissions**. Learn more about [viewing and managing settings in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-team-settings-and-permissions-in-teams-ce053b04-1b8e-4796-baa8-90dc427b3acc).

| Settings managed in SharePoint | Settings managed in Teams  |

| - Site name <br> - Site description <br> - Hub association | - Site permissions <br> - Sensitivity classification <br> - Private channel membership| 

## Channel site home page layout
For private and shared channel sites, you will find a unique home page layout that is designed to encourage and guide usage of typical SharePoint tasks. You'll find easy access to the [News web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165), [Documents web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-document-library-web-part-a9dfecc3-2050-4528-9f00-2c5afc5731b0), and links to documentation for creating lists, automating tasks, and changing the look of your site.

## Channel sites and hub associations
Just like typical SharePoint sites, [channel sites](teams-connected-sites.md) can be associated to a [SharePoint hub sites](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-a-sharepoint-hub-site-fe26ae84-14b7-45b6-a6d1-948b3966427f) from the parent team site. Upon associating the parent team to the hub, all channel sites (private and shared) will also be associated to the hub. 

When channel sites gets associated to a hub, the hub navigation gets inherited across the parent team and channel sites. The entire Team (parent team and channels) are treated as one entity.

> [!NOTE]
> Channel sites will not display hub site association in the Site information panel. These settings are managed from the parent team site.
