If you're a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can access the Term Store management tool from the SharePoint admin center. 


1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) If this opens the new SharePoint admin center, select **Classic SharePoint admin center** in the left pane.
      
3. In the left pane, select **term store**.
