# Introduction to the SharePoint Success Site

The SharePoint Success Site is a ready to deploy and customizable SharePoint communication site that helps your organization maximize the adoption of SharePoint. The SharePoint Success Site is designed to support new SharePoint Site owners in creating high-impact sites to meet the goals of your organization.

The SharePoint Success Site builds on the power of [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/) which allows you to use Microsoft-maintained playlists for training purposes. You can also create custom playlists to meet the unique training requirements of your organization. If you are already using M365 learning pathways and don't want to provision the SharePoint Success Site, you can enable the [SharePoint Success Site playlist into learning pathways](./add-sss-cdn.md).

Install the SharePoint Success Site in your tenant environment, customize the pre-populated training and site content, and then make it available to end users.
