# Get started planning and implementing SharePoint navigation design

To begin, understand that no two organizations will build identical architecture structures in SharePoint. This is because your architecture design stems from the unique needs of your organization and users. Also, remember that architectural structure will change over time as you learn more about user needs and as the business scales and grows. 

Similar to SharePoint intranet content, SharePoint architecture should be reviewed and revised as often as needed to ensure users have easy access to relevant content and resources. 

**In this article:**

- [Learn how to think about planning, implementing, and managing global, hub, and local navigation](#finally-decide-which-navigational-model-works-and-start-to-plan-and-implement)

## First: Understand your users

The most important step in planning an effective information architecture is understanding your users:

- Who are your users? What key roles do they have?
- What vocabulary to they have? What terms do they use to look for content?
- What do they want to learn?
- What do they want to do? What are their top tasks?

## Next: Understand your content

In addition to understanding your users and their experiences, you also need to understand your content. Think about how content is distributed across current intranet sites, libraries, and folders. [Look at usage data](https://support.microsoft.com/office/view-usage-data-for-your-sharepoint-site-2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e) to understand what content is accessed most and least frequently. 

Think about the categories of information in your organization, such as services, products, areas of expertise, and functions. Don’t just think about the organization chart. Think about the information people need in their daily work and the key business outcomes you want to achieve.
Use this information, and your knowledge of your users, to organize groups of related information, such as key business processes, major projects or initiatives, key business roles, frequent tasks, services, as well as organizational units.

## Then: Understand your scope

Information architecture includes five primary elements:

- **Portal navigational structure** – How you structure your sites so that users can find content including the [home site](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/home-site) of your intranet.
- **Hub structure and organization** – How you group together similar topics, tasks, and content.
- **Site and page architecture** – How content is organized on each site and page so that users can further navigate or consume content effectively.
- **Metadata architecture** – How to structure and label your individual content items for browsing and searching as well as compliance and retention.
- **Search experiences** – How your users “consume” information architecture in addition to browsing.

## Finally: Decide which navigational model works and start to plan and implement
