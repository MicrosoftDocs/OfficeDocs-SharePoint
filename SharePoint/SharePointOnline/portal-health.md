# Creating and launching a healthy SharePoint portal

A **portal** is a Microsoft SharePoint site on your intranet with many site viewers who consume the content. In large organizations, you could have several, such as a company portal and an HR portal. 

Typically portals have relatively few people who create and author the site and its content. Most visitors to the portal only read and consume the content. We don't recommend using SharePoint portals to host a town hall or live event.

>[!Tip]
> Are you wanting to host a live event or town hall?  Here are the options we recommend:
> - [Learn about Microsoft Teams live events](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events)
> - [Learn about hosting events with Yammer](/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-live-events)
> - Link directly to the live event you are streaming (**not** through your portal)

## What type of site should I use as my portal?

SharePoint Online has several types of sites and page types. **For portals, we highly recommend using a communication site with a site page for the home page**, the default configuration when you create a communication site. Site pages allow you to use out-of-the-box web parts, custom web parts, and extensions. 

To learn more, see [Create communication sites in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb). 

>[!Important]
>**Modern Team sites** are designed for use on collaboration sites, like projects / interest groups / focus areas or when you would like to collaborate with other team members. To learn more, see [Create team sites in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-team-site-in-sharepoint-ef10c1e7-15f3-42a3-98aa-b5972711777d).
>
>The **App page type** was designed to be used for specific business applications within SharePoint Online. It was not designed to be used as a SharePoint Team site or a SharePoint Portal. To learn more, see [Creating application pages in SharePoint](/visualstudio/sharepoint/creating-application-pages-for-sharepoint).
