# Provision the SharePoint Success Site from the look book

You can provision the SharePoint Success Site after you confirm that you *and* your tenant meet the following [prerequisites](./provision-sss.md#meet-the-requirements):

- You're using Global Administrator credentials.
- Your tenant has the App Catalog installed.
- You're an administrator of the App Catalog.
- Your tenant is provisioned with Microsoft 365 learning pathways version 4.0 or later.


## Start provisioning from the look book
If your tenant is already provisioned with Microsoft 365 learning pathways version 4.0 *or later*, you can provision the SharePoint Success Site from the look book. 

If you aren't sure what version of Microsoft 365 learning pathways is installed on your tenant, review the [prerequisites](./provision-sss.md#meet-the-requirements). Then provision the SharePoint Success Site. 

1. Go to the [look book](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/0b860749-56a0-4c4c-992c-536d56d9accf), and then select **Add to your tenant**.

2. Fill out the email and URL address sections, and then select **Provision**.

3. Select **Confirm**. When provisioning is complete, you see the following message:

6. Select **Home** > **Learning pathways administration**.

7. Select the **More actions** (...) button, and then select **Add to Content Pack**.

8. Select **SharePoint Success Site**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure to select **Complete** to finish the provisioning process.

11. To confirm that the SharePoint Success Site is successfully provisioned, go to the site, and then select **Get Started** > **Plan your site**. You should see the web part on the page, as the following image shows:

In the next section, you'll add site owners to the Microsoft 365 learning pathways administration page and the SharePoint Success Site. This setting grants privileges to [customize the site and content](./customize-sss.md). 


## Add site owners 
Assign a few site owners to grant administrative privileges to customize the site and training content. To hide, show, or enable playlists, users need site-owner permissions or site-member permissions to the Microsoft 365 learning pathways site. To edit the look, navigation, and site content, users need site-owner permissions or site-member permissions to the SharePoint Success Site. 

To add owners or members to both sites:

1. On the site, select **Settings** > **Site permissions**.
2. Select **Advanced Permission Settings**.
3. Select **Site owners** or **Site members**.
4. Select **New** > **Add users to this group**. Then add the people who should be site owners or site members.
5. In the sharing message, include a link to **Explore the site**. Then select **Share**.
