# Provision the SharePoint Success Site

Start the SharePoint Success Site provisioning process by understanding the prerequisites. We recommend provisioning the SharePoint Success Site from the Microsoft 365 learning pathways administration page by following the instructions in this article. Global administrator (sometimes called tenant administrator) credentials are required to start the provisioning process for the SharePoint Success Site.

Before getting started, [watch the provisioning instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZjxBAKVnJs&feature=youtu.be), follow all steps in the process, and make sure you've met the requirements for provisioning.

## Meet the requirements

Before provisioning the SharePoint Success Site, meet the requirements for both the **person** provisioning and the **tenant.** Your tenant's configuration will determine what path you need to take to install the SharePoint Success Site. Start by reviewing the SharePoint Success Site requirements below to prepare your tenant.

|Admin role requirements|+|Tenant requirements|=|Ready to provision|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

### Admin requirements

The **person** doing the provisioning must be a global admin (sometimes called a tenant admin) where the SharePoint Success Site will be provisioned *and must also be* a site admin for the App Catalog.

|Global admin role|+|Admin of the App Catalog|=|Admin role requirements met|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**Are you a global administrator?**

- **Yes** -  Next, confirm your tenant has already enabled the App Catalog.
- **No** -  Partner with your global admin to get the site provisioned. [Learn more about admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

If you aren't sure, you can confirm your role by signing in to office.com. If you're a global admin, you'll see an Admin center app icon in the app launcher next to your Microsoft 365 apps.

**Are you a site administrator for the App Catalog?**

- **Yes** - Next, confirm your tenant has Microsoft 365 learning pathways provisioned.
- **No** - Next, ask your global admin to add you as an [App Catalog administrator](/office365/customlearning/addappadmin).

#### Tenant requirements

The **tenant** where the site will be provisioned must have the [App Catalog](./use-app-catalog.md) installed *and* have the latest version of [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20learning%20pathways%20is%20a%20customizable%2C%20on-demand,adoption%20of%20Microsoft%20365%20services%20in%20your%20organization.) installed. Your tenant must have **version 4.0 or higher** of Microsoft 365 learning pathways.

|App Catalog installed|+|Microsoft 365 learning pathways 4.0 or higher installed|=|Tenant requirements met|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Use this decision tree to determine your tenant's path to meeting the **tenant** requirements.

**Does your tenant have the App Catalog installed?**

- **Yes** - Next, confirm you are an administrator of the App Catalog.
- **No** - Next, [enable the App Catalog](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=where+to+find+the+app+catogue+in+sharepoint&docid=608008189208497248&mid=99CF7FB554B328AC189899CF7FB554B328AC1898&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) (this will take about 30 minutes).

If you are unsure, navigate to the SharePoint admin center, then select **Sites** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites**</a>. The **App Catalog** will appear in the list of sites.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need to create a App Catalog, wait at least 30 minutes after creating before provisioning Microsoft 365 learning pathways and the SharePoint Success Site.

**Does your tenant have Microsoft 365 learning pathways provisioned?**

- **Yes** - Next, confirm you are using version 4.0 or higher.

- **Yes** - You are ready to [provision the SharePoint Success Site](#provision-the-sharepoint-success-site-1).
- **No** - Update to version 4.0 or higher and then provision the SharePoint Success Site from the Microsoft 365 learning pathways administration page.

If you are unsure, navigate to your tenant's **Microsoft 365 learning pathways administration page** and select the ellipses **(...)**

8. From the Learning Pathways site, select Learning pathways administration from the Home menu.
9. You'll see a prompt asking if you want to update, then select **Start**.
10. When the update is complete, select **Close**.

## Add Site owners

Assign a few Site owners to grant administrative privileges to customize the site and training content. In order to hide, show, or enable playlists, users will need Site owner or Site member permissions to the Microsoft 365 learning pathways site. In order to edit the look, navigation, and site content, users will need Site owner or Site member permissions to the SharePoint Success Site.

**Add Site owners or members to both sites**:

1. From the site select **Settings**, then select **Site permissions**.
2. Select **Advanced Permission Settings**.
3. Select **Site owners** or **Site members**
4. Select **New > Add users to this group**, and then add the people you want to be Site owners or Site members.
5. Include a link to **Explore the site** in the sharing message, and then select **Share**.

### Next steps - customize the SharePoint Success Site

Share the URLs for the Microsoft 365 learning pathways administration site and the SharePoint Success site with the Site owners and members who will be responsible for customizing the site. Then, [customize](./customize-sss.md) Microsoft 365 learning pathways playlist content and the look and feel of your SharePoint Success Site to meet the needs of your organization.
