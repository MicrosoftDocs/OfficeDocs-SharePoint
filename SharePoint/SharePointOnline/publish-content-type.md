# Publish a content type

You can publish, unpublish, or republish content types in the content type hub at /sites/ContentTypeHub or from the SharePoint admin center.

**To publish, republish, or unpublish a content type**

1. Go to the [Content type gallery page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=contentTypes&modern=true), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) for your organization. The Content type gallery page isn't available if you have the global reader role. 

2. Under the **Site content type** column, select the name of the site content type for which you want to manage updates. That site content type page appears.

3. In the menu bar, select **Publish**. The **Manage Publishing** panel appears.

4. On the **Manage Publishing** page, do one of the following:

    - To make this content type available for download to all sites in the organization, select **Publish**.
    - To publish updates to this content type, select **Republish**.

    - To make this content type unavailable for download to sites in the organization, select **Unpublish**. Any copies of this content type being used in other sites will be converted to a local content type.

5. Select **Save**.
