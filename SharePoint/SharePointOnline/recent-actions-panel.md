# Review recent SharePoint site actions

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

With the recent SharePoint admin actions panel, you can make changes to SharePoint site properties and review your most recent 30 actions in the [SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/get-started-new-admin-center).

Changes to site properties like site name, site deletion and storage quota, show as recent actions. The panel shows the previous and current values of site properties, which can be useful when tracking changes.

The recent actions panel only shows changes you made in the last 30 days. Changes made by other admins and organization-level changes won't show in the panel.

You can also download a .csv file of all your changes made in the last 30 days.

## View recent actions of a site

1. In the SharePoint admin center, expand **Sites** and select **Active sites**.
2. Select **Your recent actions**. The recent actions panel appears on the right and lists your most recent 30 actions made within the last 30 days.
3. Select **Export** to download the list as a .csv file.
4. Select **View site details** to open the site info panel. From here, you can make changes to site properties like site name, site address, hub association, and aliases.

## Bulk site edits

Bulk edits are listed as one action item in the recent actions panel. Select a bulk action item to see a list of sites affected by a bulk edit. Bulk edits show as separate items in the .csv file. The bulk edit column lets you quickly filter which changes were part of a bulk edit.

Here’s an example of how bulk edits are grouped as one action in the recent actions panel:

You deleted 4 SharePoint sites on May 21 at 6:15 PM. The bulk edit will show as one item named Deleted 4 sites on the recent actions panel. Select the Deleted 4 sites action and the list of deleted SharePoint sites appears.
