# Remove columns from a content type

Columns can be added and removed from content types as necessary. To remove a column from a content type, follow these steps:

**To remove a column from a content type**

1. Go to the [Content type gallery page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=contentTypes&modern=true), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) for your organization. The Content type gallery page isn't available if you have the global reader role. 

2. Under the **Site content type** column, select the name of the site content type to which you want to remove a column.

3. Under **Site columns**, select the column name you want to remove.

4. Select the vertical ellipsis to the right of the site column name you selected, and from the dropdown, select **Delete**. A **Delete site column** dialog box appears prompting you that this action will remove the column from the content type.

5. Select **Delete** to confirm.
