# Remove search results

As a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can temporarily remove items from search results with immediate effect. The items that you can remove can be documents, pages, or sites that you don't want users to see. An example of this could be a Word document containing an invitation to an event that has been cancelled, but the organizer has not removed the document from the site yet. Removing a result removes it from both classic and modern search results. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This is only a quick fix! Unless you delete the items or change the permissions of items manually, they will show up again in your search results after the next crawl. 
  
1. Go to the [More features page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=classicfeatures&modern=true) and sign in with an account that has admin permissions for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have Office 365 Germany, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page. <br>If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page.
 
2. Under **Search**, select **Open**.
   
3. On the search administration page, choose **Remove Search Results**.
    
4. On the Remove Search Results page, in the **URLs to remove** box, type the URLs that you want to remove from the search results. Type one URL on each line. 
    
5. Select **Remove Now**. The URLs are immediately removed from your search results.
