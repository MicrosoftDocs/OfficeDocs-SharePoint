# Restrict SharePoint site access

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

With restricted access control, you can manage the access of a SharePoint site and its content. As a [SharePoint administrator](sharepoint-admin-role.md), you can grant access to specified users in the group associated with a SharePoint site. Users who aren't added to the specified group can't access even if they previously had site access permissions to a file. **The restricted access control policy applies to Microsoft 365 group-connected sites, non-group connected sites and Microsoft Teams.**

Restricting site access based on group membership reduces the risk of oversharing within your organization. To view how data is shared in your organization, use [data access governance reports](data-access-governance-reports.md). Restricted access control provides an extra layer of security to safeguard site content. By enabling restricted site access, you apply a policy that prevents access of content by users who aren't a member of the specified group.

For example, the Contoso tenant's research department has a Microsoft 365 group containing all their department members. The department doesn't want anyone outside of the department to access the research team site or its content. They enable restricted access control on the site to restrict access to the research department's Microsoft 365 group. Only users who are members of the Microsoft 365 group can access the site and its content.

[SharePoint PowerShell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell) module is required to enable restricted access control.

## Requirements

To access and use this feature, your organization must do as follows:

- subscribe to **[Microsoft Syntex - SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md)** before following these instructions.
- download the latest **[SharePoint PowerShell module](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell)**
- enable **restricted access control for your organization**:
  1.  Run the following command:
      ```Powershell
      Set-SPOTenant -EnableRestrictedAccessControl $true
      ```

  2. Wait for approximately 1 hour.
  3. Manage restricted access control for that site.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, you must run this command for each geo-location you want to use restricted access control.

## Teams and Microsoft 365 group-connected sites

You can enable restricted access control for your group-connected or Teams-connected sites using Microsoft 365 group membership. Restricted access control grants access to members of the Microsoft 365 group connected to the site. Users who aren't ***members of the Microsoft 365 group*** can't access the site and its content.

### Enable restricted access control for group-connected sites

To apply restricted access control to a group-connected or Teams-connected site, use the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RestrictedAccessControl $true
```

**For example:**

`Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchTeamSite -RestrictedAccessControl $true`

### View restricted access control for group-connected sites

To view the restricted access control configuration for a site, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> | Select RestrictedAccessControl
```

### Remove restricted access control for group-connected sites

To remove restricted access control from a site, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RestrictedAccessControl $false
```

**For example:**

`Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchTeamSite -RestrictedAccessControl $false`

## Sites not connected to Teams or Microsoft 365 groups

With restricted access control, you can ***restrict site access to members of specified [Azure AD security groups](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups)*** using [SharePoint PowerShell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell). Users who aren't members of the specified security groups can't access even if they previously had site access permissions to the site or its content. **You can apply restricted access control on a site with up to 10 security groups.**

### Enable restricted access control for non-group connected sites

To enable restricted access control for a non-group connected site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RestrictedAccessControl $true
```

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -AddRestrictedAccessControlGroups <comma separated group GUIDS>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For restricted access control to be enforced on the site, you must add at least one security group whose members are allowed site access.
> - You can add up to 10 Security Groups for a given site.
> - The users in the security group will automatically have access to the site.

**For example:**

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketingdepartment -RestrictedAccessControl $true
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/marketingdepartment -AddRestrictedAccessControlGroups AFD516B5-C350-4C2A-8339-600B93C56791
```

After running the commands, you have restricted site access to members of the specified security group (Employees_MarketingDepartment).

> [!TIP]
> To identify corresponding GUID for a given security group (say Employees_MarketingDepartment), run the following commands:
>
> ```Powershell
> Install-Module -Name MSOnline
> Import-Module -Name MSOnline 
> Connect- MsolService
> $group = Get-MsolGroup | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq " Employees_MarketingDepartment "}
> $group.ObjectId
> ```

### Manage restricted access control groups for a non-group site

You can add up to 10 Azure AD security groups whose members will be allowed access to the site. The specified security groups can be managed as **restricted access control groups** when the setting is applied. Restricted access control will now limit the site access to members of the specified security groups.

To edit a restricted access control group for a non-group site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RestrictedAccessControlGroups <comma separated group GUIDS>
```

**For example:**

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/LegalDepartmentSite -RestrictedAccessControlGroups afd516b5-c350-4c2a-8339-600b93c56791,053e8286-f18a-40d6-a12a-a323b89c5d63
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The security groups specified will automatically get access to the site permissions.
> - The policy is enforced only when it is enabled on the site and has at least one security group added.

### Remove restricted access control groups for a non-group site

You can remove the specified security group from restricted access control configuration. Members of
the security group will no longer be able to access site content while the policy is enforced on the site.

To remove a security group from a restricted access control configuration for the non-group site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RemoveRestrictedAccessControlGroups <comma separated group GUIDS>
```

**For example:**

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/LegalDepartmentSite -RemoveRestrictedAccessControlGroups afd516b5-c350-4c2a-8339-600b93c56791
```

> [!TIP]
> The security groups removed from the restricted access control list will continue to have site permissions. We recommend SPO admin to review site permissions and remove users who should no longer have site access permissions.

### View restricted access control for a non-group site

To view the restricted access control configuration for a site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Get-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> | Select RestrictedAccessControl, RestrictedAccessControlGroups
```

To view the complete list of security groups added in the restricted access control configuration for a site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Get-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> | Select -EXPAND RestrictedAccessControlGroups
```

> [!NOTE]
> The security groups added for this setting are also added to the ***SharePoint members group*** for the site. When disabling the setting, it is recommended to review site permissions and remove users who no longer need access to the site.

## Shared channel sites

For [shared channel sites](/microsoftteams/shared-channels), only internal users in the resource tenant are subject to restricted access control. External users are excluded from restricted access control policy and only evaluated per the site’s existing [site permissions](/microsoftteams/shared-channels).

**For example:**

The Contoso tenant has set up a manual trust relation with another Azure AD organization Fabrikam, via [B2B direct connect](/microsoftteams/shared-channels).  When restricted access control is enabled for a shared channel site in Contoso tenant, only users in Contoso will be subjected to restricted access control policy. Fabrikam users will continue to be evaluated for site permissions only.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Site permissions for a shared channel site can’t be managed independently through SharePoint and must be done in Microsoft Teams.

## Auditing

Audit events are available in [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) to help you monitor restricted access control activities. Audit events are logged for the following activities:

1. Applying restricted access control for site
2. Removing restricted access control for site
3. Changing restricted access control groups for site
