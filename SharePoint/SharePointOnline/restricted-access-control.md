# Restrict access to a SharePoint site by Microsoft 365 group membership

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

With restricted access control, you can manage the access of a SharePoint site and its content. As a [SharePoint administrator](sharepoint-admin-role.md), you'll  grant access to users of the Microsoft 365 group associated with a SharePoint site. Users who aren't added to the group membership can't access even if they previously had site access permissions to a file. Restricted access control policy also applies to Microsoft 365 group memberships associated with Microsoft Teams.

Restricting site access based on group membership reduces the risk of oversharing within your organization. Restricted access control provides an extra layer of security to safeguard site content. By enabling restricted site access, you apply a policy that stops sharing content with people who aren't a member of the Microsoft 365 group. Use and consult [data access governance reports](data-access-governance-reports.md) to see how data is currently being shared.

For example, the research department has a Microsoft 365 group containing all of their department members. They donâ€™t want anyone outside of the department to have access to the research department site or its contents. To restrict site access to the research department's Microsoft 365 group, you enable restricted access control using PowerShell.

[PowerShell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell) is required to enable restricted access control.

## Requirements

To access and use this feature, your organization must have the following subscription:

- [Microsoft Syntex - SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md)

## Enable restricted access control for your organization

To enable restricted access control in SharePoint, run the following command:

```Powershell
Set-SPOTenant -EnableRestrictedAccessControl $true
```

Then, wait for approximately 1 hour before managing restricted access control for that site.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, you must run this command for each geo-location you want to use restricted access control.

## Enable restricted access control for your SharePoint site

You can enable restricted access control on a group-connected or Teams-connected site by running the following command:

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RestrictedAccessControl $true
```

**For example:**

`Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchTeamSite -RestrictedAccessControl $true`

## View restricted access control for site

To view the restricted access control configuration for a site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Get-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> | Select RestrictedAccessControl
```

## Remove restricted access control for site

To remove restricted access control from a site, run the following command:

```Powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity <siteurl> -RestrictedAccessControl $false
```

**For example:**

`Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchTeamSite -RestrictedAccessControl $false`

## Auditing

Audit events are available in Microsoft Purview compliance portal to help you monitor restricted access control activities. Audit events are logged for the following activities:

1. Applying Restricted Access Control for site
2. Removing Restricted Access Control for site
