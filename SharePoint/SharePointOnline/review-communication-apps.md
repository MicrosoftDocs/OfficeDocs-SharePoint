## Teams: Video conferencing, chat, and live events
Set up, customize, and collaborate in teams and channels. Get work done using channel posts, chats, calls, and online meetings. Teams is a great place to target information to smaller or more specific teams in your organization. Integrate resources from SharePoint like pages, lists, and document libraries as tabs in Microsoft Teams.  For example, you might have a team for your sales department with a channel for event announcements that includes resources from your Sales team site in SharePoint.
