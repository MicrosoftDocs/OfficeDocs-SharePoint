# Mark new files as sensitive by default

When new files are added to SharePoint or OneDrive in Microsoft 365, it takes a while for them to be crawled and indexed. It takes additional time for the [Office Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-loss-prevention-policies) to scan the content and apply rules to help protect sensitive content. If external sharing is turned on, sensitive content could be shared and accessed by guests before the Office DLP rule finishes processing.   

Instead of turning off external sharing entirely, you can address this issue by using a new PowerShell cmdlet. The cmdlet prevents guests from accessing newly added files until at least one Office DLP policy scans the content of the file. If the file has no sensitive content based on the DLP policy, then guests can access the file. If the policy identifies sensitive content, then guests will not be able to access the file. 

> [!NOTE]
> This cmdlet applies to newly added files in all SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts. It doesn't block sharing if an existing file is changed.

1. Make sure you have at least one DLP policy turned on for content located in SharePoint. [Learn how to create and turn on a DLP policy](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-test-tune-dlp-policy)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The DLP policy must include all SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts and exclude none.

2. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell." <br>On the Download Center page, select your language and then click the Download button. You'll be asked to choose between downloading a x64 and x86 .msi file. Download the x64 file if you're running the 64-bit version of Windows or the x86 file if you're running the 32-bit version. If you don't know, see [Which version of Windows operating system am I running?](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system). After the file downloads, run it and follow the steps in the Setup Wizard.

3. Connect to SharePoint as a [global admin or SharePoint admin](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
    
4. Run the following command:
  
    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOTenant -MarkNewFilesSensitiveByDefault BlockExternalSharing 
    ```

To disable this feature, run `Set-SPOTenant -MarkNewFilesSensitiveByDefault AllowExternalSharing`.
