# About the SharePoint Administrator role in Microsoft 365

Global Administrators in Microsoft 365 can assign users the SharePoint Administrator role for help with administering Microsoft SharePoint. The global admin role already has all the permissions of the SharePoint Administrator role. For info about assigning a user the SharePoint Administrator role, see [Assign admin roles in Microsoft 365 for business](/office365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles).

For info about adding or removing a site admin (previously called "site collection administrator"), see [Manage site admins](manage-site-collection-administrators.md).

Users assigned the SharePoint Administrator role have access to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219" target="_blank">SharePoint admin center</a> and can create and manage sites (previously called "site collections"), designate site admins, manage sharing settings, and more. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - SharePoint Administrators can now manage Microsoft 365 groups, including creating, deleting, and restoring groups, and changing group owners.
> - If a userâ€™s role is changed so they gain or lose access to the SharePoint admin center, it takes about an hour for the change to take effect.

Global Administrators and SharePoint Administrators don't have automatic access to all sites and each user's OneDrive, but they can give themselves access to any site or OneDrive. They can also use Microsoft PowerShell to manage SharePoint and OneDrive. See more about this role's [Key tasks of the SharePoint admin](sharepoint-admin-role.md#BK_KeyTasks) below. 
  
Site admins are users that have permission to manage sites, including any subsites. They don't need to have an admin role in Microsoft 365, and aren't given access to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219" target="_blank">SharePoint admin center</a>. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Global Administrators, SharePoint Administrators, and site admins all need to be assigned a SharePoint license. If you have a standalone OneDrive for Business plan, admins can access the SharePoint admin center without a SharePoint license.
>
> There is a separate role within SharePoint called the **Term Store administrator**. Users assigned this role can add or change terms in the term store (a directory of common terms you want to use across your organization). To learn more, see [Assign roles and permissions to manage term sets](assign-roles-and-permissions-to-manage-term-sets.md).
