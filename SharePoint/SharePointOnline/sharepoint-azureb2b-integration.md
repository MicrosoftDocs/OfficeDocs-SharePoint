# SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B 

This article describes how to enable Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B.

Azure AD B2B provides authentication and management of guests. Authentication happens via one-time passcode when they don't already have a work or school account or a Microsoft account.

With SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure B2B Invitation Manager enabled, Azure B2B Invitation Manager can be used for sharing of files, folders, list items, document libraries and sites with people outside your organization. This feature provides an upgraded experience from the existing secure external sharing recipient experience. Additionally, Azure B2B Invitation Manager one-time passcode feature allows users who don't have existing Work or School accounts or Microsoft Accounts to not have to create accounts to authenticate, but can instead use the one time passcode to verify their identity.

Enabling this integration doesn't change your sharing settings. For example, if you have site collections where external sharing is turned off, it will remain off.

Once the integration is enabled you and your users don't have to reshare or do any manual migration for guests previously shared with. Instead, when someone outside your organization clicks on a link that was created before Azure AD B2B integration was enabled, SharePoint will automatically create a B2B guest account. This guest account is created for the user who originally created the sharing link. (If the user who created the link is no longer in the organization or no longer has permission to share, the guest won't be added to the directory and the file will need to be reshared.)

SharePoint and OneDrive integration with the Azure AD B2B one-time passcode feature is currently not enabled by default.

Advantages of Azure AD B2B include:
- Invited people outside your organization are each given an account in the directory and are subject to Azure AD access policies such as multi-factor authentication.
- Invitations to a SharePoint site use Azure AD B2B and no longer require users to have or create a Microsoft account.
- If you've configured Google federation in Azure AD, federated users can now access SharePoint and OneDrive resources that you've shared with them.
- SharePoint and OneDrive sharing is subject to the Azure AD organizational relationships settings, such as **Members can invite** and **Guests can invite**. As with Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams, if an Azure AD organizational relationship setting is more restrictive than a SharePoint or OneDrive setting, the Azure AD setting will prevail.

This integration isn't supported in the following Microsoft 365 services:
- Office 365 operated by 21Vianet
- GCC High and DoD

 > [!NOTE]
 > At this time, customers in national and restricted clouds who enable Azure B2B Integration with SharePoint Online won't be able to share files and folders with recipients outside those environments.

## Enabling the integration

 > [!NOTE]
 > When the integration is enabled, people outside the organization will be invited via the Azure B2B platform when sharing from SharePoint. They will sign in based on the [Azure AD B2B redemption policy](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/redemption-experience#invitation-redemption-flow).
> When the integration isn't enabled, people outside the organization will continue to use their existing accounts created when previously invited to the tenant. Any sharing to new people outside the organizaton may result in either Azure AD-backed accounts or SharePoint-only email auth guests that use a SharePoint One Time Passcode experience to sign in.

 >[!NOTE]
 > Review any custom [domain sharing restrictions in SharePoint and OneDrive](/sharepoint/restricted-domains-sharing) and decide if they should be moved to the [Azure AD B2B Allow/Deny list](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/allow-deny-list). The Azure AD Allow/Deny list also affects other Microsoft 365 services like Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups.

To enable SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B

1. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell." 

2. Connect to SharePoint as a [Global Administrator or SharePoint Administrator](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

3. Run the following cmdlets:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-SPOTenant -EnableAzureADB2BIntegration $true
   ```

## Disabling the integration

You can disable the integration by running '[Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant) -EnableAzureADB2BIntegration $false'. 

> [!Important]
> Once disabled, users who were shared to while the integration was enabled will always be an AAD Guest User for future shares. To convert a user from an AAD Guest User back to a SharePoint OTP user, you will need to [delete the guest](/sharepoint/remove-users#delete-a-guest-from-the-microsoft-365-admin-center) in AAD and remove all SPUser objects in your organization that reference that guest user.
