# Sharing errors in SharePoint and OneDrive

This article covers the different errors that you might encounter when sharing files or folders from SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business in Office 365. You need to be a global or SharePoint admin in your organization to fix these errors. If you are not an administrator, contact your help desk and give them your error code.

Note that changing these settings changes the types of external sharing that are allowed in your organization. In some cases, these settings may have been set by someone in your organization for business reasons.

## OSE201

Error OSE201 indicates that external sharing is turned off for all of your SharePoint and OneDrive sites.

First, change the external sharing setting for your organization:

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.   
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) 
3. In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, select **sharing**.
4. Under **Sharing outside your organization**, choose **Allow users to invite and share with authenticated external users** or **Allow sharing to authenticated external users and using anonymous access links**.
5. Click **OK**

Next, check the external sharing settings for the site that you want to share from.
