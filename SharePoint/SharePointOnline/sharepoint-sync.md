# SharePoint file sync

When users install the OneDrive sync app for Windows or Mac, and sync the files on a team site, they can work with the files in File Explorer or Finder. They can also easily save files to the team site from the programs they use.

When users add, change, and delete files and folders on the site, the files and folders are automatically added, changed, or deleted on their computer and vice versa.

To upload files to the team site, users can simply copy or move them to the site in File Explorer or Finder. They can also use File Explorer or Finder to easily organize the document library by creating new folders, and moving and renaming files and folders. All these changes sync automatically.

Windows 10 devices come with the OneDrive sync app installed. Office 2016 and later installations also have the sync app installed.
