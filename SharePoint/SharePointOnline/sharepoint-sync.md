# Sync in SharePoint and OneDrive

When users install the OneDrive sync app for Windows or Mac, and sync the files on a team site, they can work with the files in File Explorer or Finder. They can also easily save files to the team site from the programs they use.

If the user adds, changes, or deletes files and folders on the site, the changes also apply to the files and folders of the user's computer and vice versa.

To upload files to the team site, users can copy or move them to the site in File Explorer or Finder. They can also use File Explorer or Finder to easily organize the document library by creating new folders, and moving and renaming files and folders. All these changes sync automatically.

Windows 10 devices come with the OneDrive sync app installed. Office 2016 and later installations also have the sync app installed.

## SharePoint file sync and OneDrive shortcuts

Users have two options when syncing files in SharePoint libraries and Teams. They can

- [Add shortcuts to libraries and folders to their OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/d66b1347-99b7-4470-9360-ffc048d35a33).
- [Use the Sync button in the document library](https://support.microsoft.com/office/6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88).

## Deciding between OneDrive sync options

Both OneDrive shortcuts and OneDrive Sync options allow essentially the same thingâ€”users can access files on their local computer in Explorer or Finder.

However, adding OneDrive shortcuts allows content to be accessed on all devices, whereas sync is related to a specific device. Additionally, OneDrive shortcuts offer improved performance versus using the sync button.

We recommend using OneDrive shortcuts as the more versatile option.

### Turn off OneDrive sync for SharePoint libraries

You can turn off OneDrive sync from all the SharePoint libraries in your organization by using this [Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant) PowerShell cmdlet to remove the OneDrive sync button:

```PowerShell
Set-SPOTenant -HideSyncButtonOnTeamSite $true
```

Removing the sync button blocks new syncs from being started but doesn't affect existing syncs.
