# Report on file and folder sharing in a SharePoint site

You can create a CSV file of every unique file, user, permission and link on a given SharePoint site or OneDrive. This can help you understand how sharing is being used and if any files or folders are being shared with guests. You must be a site admin to run the report.

When you run the report, the CSV file is saved to a location of your choosing on the site. 

In Microsoft SharePoint, if you don't want site members to see the report, consider creating a folder with different permissions where only site owners can access the report.

To run the report (SharePoint)
1. Open the site where you want to run the report
2. On the **Settings** menu, click **Site usage**.
3. In the **Shared with external users** section, click **Run report**.
4. Choose a location to save the report, and then click **Save**.

To run the report (OneDrive)
1. From the Microsoft 365 app launcher, select the OneDrive tile.
2. On the **Settings** menu, click **OneDrive settings**.
3. Click **More settings**, and then click **Run sharing report**.
4. Choose a location to save the report, and then click **Save**.

The report may take some time to run depending on the size of the site.

When the report is finished running you will receive an email with a link to the report.

## CSV format

For items shared with direct access, the report contains one row for each user / item combination. SharePoint groups are shown in the report, but not individual users inside them.

For items shared with a link, the report contains a row for each signed-in user who has used the link or has been sent the link through the sharing dialog. Links emailed directly that haven't been clicked, and *Anyone* links are not included in the report.

The report contains the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Resource Path|The relative URL of the item|
|Item Type|The type of item (web, folder, file, etc.)|
|Permission|The permission level the user has on this item|
|User Name|Friendly name of the user or group that has access to this item. If this is a sharing link, the user name is *SharingLink*|
|User E-mail|The email address of the user who has access to this item. This is blank for SharePoint groups.|
|User or Group Type|The type of user or group: Member (internal), Guest (external), SharePoint group, Security group or Microsoft 365 group. (Note that *Member* refers to a member in the directory, not a member of the site.)|
|Link ID|The GUID of the sharing link if user name is *Sharing Link*|
|Link Type|The type of link (Anonymous, Company, Specific People) if user name is *Sharing Link*|
|AccessViaLinkID|The **Link ID** used to access the item if a user's permission to an item is via a link.
