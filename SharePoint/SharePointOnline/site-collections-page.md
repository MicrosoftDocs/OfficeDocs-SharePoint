# Find site collection features in the new SharePoint admin center

This article covers all the features on the classic site collections page and where you can find them in the new <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219" target="_blank">SharePoint admin center</a>.

As with the classic SharePoint admin center, you can't delete the root (top-level) site. To swap this site with a different site, see [Replace your root site](./modern-root-site.md).

## Properties

The columns on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites** page</a> show most of this information, so you don't even need to select a site to see details. To see the properties for an individual site, select anywhere in the site row, except in the URL column.

## Available storage and storage limit bar

## Available resources bar

Server resource quota and availability have had no effect for more than a year. 

## Project Web App instances available

This information is no longer displayed because you shouldn't need to worry about running out of Project Web App instances.

## Site list

![Storage columns](media/storage-columns.png)

Most of the sites that were listed in the classic SharePoint admin center are included on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220" target="_blank">**Active sites** page</a>. A few are hidden because they're system sites that you shouldn't need to change. The Active sites page contains all the new team sites and communication sites that didn't appear in the classic SharePoint admin center. To see the site list as it appeared in the classic SharePoint admin center, from the **Built-in views** menu, select **Classic sites**.  

In both the classic and new admin centers, you can select multiple sites and bulk edit the sharing or storage settings, or delete the sites.  

In the classic site list, locked sites appeared with an icon. In the new SharePoint admin center, to see if a site is locked, select the site to open the details panel. **This site is locked** appears at the top of the panel. 

If you use manual storage limits, the Storage limit and Percent used columns appear. In the new SharePoint admin center, the Storage limit and Storage used columns appear. The Storage used column isn't color coded. The Storage limit column can be sorted by size.
