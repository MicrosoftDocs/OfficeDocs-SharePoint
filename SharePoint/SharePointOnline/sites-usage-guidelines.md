# Create guidelines for site usage

Using the steps below as a template, create your own custom guidance for site owners on how sites are set up and managed in your organization. Each section provides guidance about what to include, sample text to help you get started, and links to resources to learn more about each area.

- Include information on custom provisioning solutions.</br>
- Are there any ownership or site classification requirements your organization has implemented? </br>

*You should have two site owners who are both full time employees at your org.*

## ![Alt image text](media/navigation.png "Site design")  Your site designs and customizations

**Guidance:**</br>
- Provide information on design guidelines. Does your organization have or allow custom themes? Or do you stick with out-of-the-box options?
- Do you have specific templates or web parts you want site owners to use? Explain those so they understand why and how. 
- Does your organization allow custom scripts and add-ins?
- We recommend creating a way for site owners to engage with your team when they want to customize a site. Set up a service ticket category or form to make it easy to contact you. 

**Resources:**</br>

- [SharePoint site theming overview](/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-theming/sharepoint-site-theming-overview)

## ![Alt image text](media/sharing.png "Sharing") Sharing guidelines

**Guidance:**</br>
- Provide information on the way your organization has set up sharing. If you have modified the settings from the defaults, you can tell your site owners what the sharing settings are for your organization, including for external sharing. 

**Resources:** </br>
- [Plan your permissions strategy](plan-your-permissions-strategy.md)


**Sample text:** </br>

*As site owner, you will receive access requests when someone shares your site. You can approve or decline any requests sent to you.*

 
## ![Alt image text](media/capacity.png "Capacity")  Capacity guidelines 

**Guidance:** </br>
- Provide information on the site storage guidelines or limits (if you manage them manually). Tell site owners if you have a process and policy for requesting more.

**Resources:**</br>
- [Manage site storage limits](manage-site-collection-storage-limits.md)

**Sample text:** </br>
*Your site allows for _____ MB/GB of storage. You’re encouraged to remove files and content you don't need anymore.*

 
## ![Alt image text](media/secure.png "Access")   Managing access

**Guidance:**</br>
- Provide detailed information on site access. What are your processes and policies for managing site access? What level of control do your site owners have? If you manage access on behalf of your site owners, let them know that you will be reviewing site permissions regularly to keep them in line with your organization’s policies. Explain how you will communicate changes to permissions to them.

**Resources:** </br>
- [Secure SharePoint Online Sites and Files](/office365/securitycompliance/secure-sharepoint-online-sites-and-files)

**Sample text:** </br>
*Plan to review your site’s permissions on a regular basis and set the level of access appropriately.*


## ![Alt image text](media/policy.png "Policy")   Site lifecycle policy

**Guidance:**</br>
- Provide your organization's lifecycle policy for sites. Does your organization set site expirations automatically or with a managed process? Do you set Office 365 Group expiration policies that impact SharePoint team sites? Let your site owners know when their site will expire, how they will be notified, what will happen and what they need to do to extend their site.
- Setting this policy requires Microsoft 365 global admin permissions.
- Does your organization take extra measures related to site backup and restore? Let your site owners know how long the backup is available and if needed, how to get a site restored.
