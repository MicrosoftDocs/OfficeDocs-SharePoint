# Search Center settings

As a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, you specify where searches should go for your classic site collection or site by specifying the URL of your Search Center. For example, if you've created an Enterprise Search Center which users can use to search everything in your company, you must enter the URL of that site here.
  
## Enter the address of your Search Center
<a name="__goback"> </a>

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185077" target="_blank">**More features** in the SharePoint admin center</a>, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page.
 
2. Under **Search**, select **Open**.
    
3. On the **search administration** page, select **Search Center Settings**.
    
4. In the **Search Center URL** box, enter the URL of the Search Center site.
  
    Example: http://companyportal/searchcenter/pages.
    
5. Select **OK**.
