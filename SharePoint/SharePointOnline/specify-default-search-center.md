# Search Center settings

As a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, you can specify where searches should go for your classic site collection or site by specifying the URL of your Search Center. For example, if you have created an Enterprise Search Center where users can search everything in your company, you can enter the URL of that site here.
  
## Enter the address of your Search Center
<a name="__goback"> </a>

1. Go to the [More features page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=classicfeatures&modern=true) and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have Microsoft 365 Germany, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page. <br>If you have Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page.
 
2. Under **Search**, select **Open**.
    
3. On the search administration page, choose **Search Center Settings**.
    
4. In the **Search Center URL** box, type the URL of the Search Center site.
