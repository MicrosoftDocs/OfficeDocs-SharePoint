# Search Center settings

As a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can specify where searches should go by specifying the URL of your Search Center. For example, if you have created an Enterprise Search Center where users can search everything in your company, you can enter the URL of that site here. 
  
## Enter the address of your Search Center
<a name="__goback"> </a>

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) 

3. If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.
    
4. Select **Classic features**. 
 
5. Under **Search**, select **Open**.
    
6. On the search administration page, choose **Search Center Settings**.
    
7. In the **Search Center URL** box, type the URL of the Search Center site. 
  
    Example: http://companyportal/searchcenter/pages.
    
8. Select **OK**.
