# Use the sync app on virtual desktops

For all [supported operating systems](https://support.office.com/article/cc0cb2b8-f446-445c-9b52-d3c2627d681e), the OneDrive sync app supports:

- Virtual desktops that persist between sessions.
- Non-persistent virtual desktops that use [Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop).
- Non-persistent virtual desktops that have [FSLogix Apps](/fslogix/configure-profile-container-tutorial) or [FSLogix Office Container](/fslogix/configure-office-container-tutorial), and a Microsoft 365 subscription for all of the following operating systems:
  - Windows 10 and 11, 32-bit or 64-bit (supports VMDK files)
  - Windows Server 2022 (supports VHDX)
  - Windows Server 2019 (supports VHDX)
  - Windows Server 2016 (supports VHDX)
  - Windows Server 2012 R2 (supports VHDX)

> [!NOTE]
> It is not supported to roam the OneDrive registry hive as part of a non-persistent VDI environment. Do not roam `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive\` in your non-persistent VDI user profiles.

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum supported versions are: OneDrive 19.174.0902.0013 and FSLogix Apps [2.9.7653.47581](/fslogix/whats-new).
>
> Using the OneDrive sync app with non-persistent environments requires that you [install the sync app per machine](./per-machine-installation.md).
>
> For Windows Server, the [SMB network file sharing protocol](/windows-server/storage/file-server/file-server-smb-overview) is also required.
>
> The OneDrive sync app is supported in a remote app scenario hosted as a Citrix Virtual App.
>
> The OneDrive sync app with FSLogix does not support running multiple instances of the same container simultaneously.

## Set up OneDrive in Citrix Virtual Apps

This article describes how to enable and use OneDrive in Citrix Virtual Apps.

### Prerequisites

To enable OneDrive in Citrix Virtual Apps, you must have the following versions of Windows and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (CVAD):

**Windows**:

- Windows 11: KB5014019
- Windows Server 2022: KB5014021
- Windows 10: KB5014023
- Windows Server 2019: KB5014022

**Citrix**:

- CVAD 7 2203 LTSR CU1 or later.
- VDA 2212 enables Shellbridge by default. All earlier versions require Shellbridge to be enabled manually.
- To enable this feature, On 2203 LTSR TS VDA (2019 Server, 2022 Server, Windows 10 RDSH, or Windows 11 RDSH) add the following registry details:

    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Citrix\Citrix Virtual Desktop Agent`<p>
    `Name: Shellbridge`<p>
    `Type: REG_DWORD`<p>
    `Value: 1`

To ensure that the feature is correctly enabled, open a command window (cmd.exe) and run `start ms-settings:printers`. If the feature is enabled, the printer setting window is displayed.

**We recommend adding OneDrive.exe to `LogoffCheckSysModules`**.

   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Citrix\wfshell\TWI` <p>
   `Value Name:LogoffCheckSysModules` <p>
   `Type:REG_SZ` <p>
   `String:OneDrive.exe, Microsoft.Sharepoint.exe` <p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [FSLogix](/fslogix/how-to-install-fslogix) must be used in conjunction with Citrix Virtual Apps for OneDrive to be supported.

## Set up OneDrive in Horizon Virtual Apps

In this article, you'll learn how to enable OneDrive in Horizon Virtual Apps.

### Prerequisites

•	Omnissa Horizon\
•	Microsoft Windows OS

All the Omnissa Horizon and Windows OS requirements are detailed in the below articles which can be referred prior to the Horizon Virtual App environment configurations.

[Supported Windows 10 and Windows 11 Guest Operating Systems for Horizon Agent and Remote Experience, for Omnissa Horizon 8.x (2006 and later) (78714)](https://kb.omnissa.com/s/article/78714)\
[Supported Non-Windows 10 and 11 Guest Operating Systems for Horizon 8 Agent (78715)](https://kb.omnissa.com/s/article/78715)\
•	Omnissa Dynamic Environment Manager (DEM) or a product which enables the user environment personalization. 

The system on which you plan to install DEM must meet certain software requirements.
Please refer to the article for more information.

https://docs.omnissa.com/bundle/DEMInstallConfigGuideV2406/page/SoftwareRequirements.html

### Required registry keys

Following registries help to roam the user environment on multiple nodes in the virtual application farm. We can use Omnissa Dynamic Environment Manager or a similar user environment management tool to deploy the registry to all farm servers.

    (IncludeRegistryTrees)
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office 
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Cached
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive

    (IncludeFolderTrees)
    <Appdata>\Microsoft\Windows\Recent
    <Appdata>\Microsoft\crypto
    <Appdata>\SystemCertificates
    <LocalAppdata>\Microsoft\IdentityCache
    <LocalAppdata>\Microsoft\Internet Explorer
    <LocalAppdata>\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache

### Configure Omnissa Dynamic Environment Manager with Horizon Apps 

1.	Launch the Omnissa Dynamic Environment Manager management console, select **Create Config File** and select **Use an Application Template**.

2.	Select the application template (Microsoft Office 2016 and 2019, or Microsoft 365), Select **OneDrive for Business** and click **Next**.

3.	Provide the file name and description and select **Finish**.

4.	Add the previously listed **required registry keys** to **Import / Export** settings.

### How to set up OneDrive

1. Install OneDrive Sync app per machine. See [Install the sync app per-machine](per-machine-installation.md).
1. Install the latest version of FSLogix. See [Install FSLogix Applications](/fslogix/how-to-install-fslogix).

    > [!NOTE]
    > All non-persistent VDI environments require the latest version of FSLogix. Ensure you install the latest version. See [OneDrive sync error FSLogix_unsupported_environment on VMs](/sharepoint/troubleshoot/sync/fslogix-unsupported-environment-sync-error-vm).

1. Add OneDrive to `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\` by using the following command:

    `REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v OneDrive /t REG_SZ /d "\"C:\Program Files\Microsoft OneDrive\OneDrive.exe\" /background"`

1. Silently configure user accounts. See [Silently configure user accounts](use-silent-account-configuration.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Silent sign-in should work if your machine is connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Make sure to turn off this setting if your computer is not Microsoft Entra joined.
