# Rename your SharePoint domain

It's now possible to change the SharePoint domain name for your organization in Microsoft 365. For example, if the name of your organization changes from "Contoso" to "Fabrikam," you can change `contoso.sharepoint.com` to `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.

> [!IMPORTANT]

Note that submitting a nomination does not guarantee acceptance into the program. We review the nominations on a case-by-case basis and will contact you if you're accepted.
> - This feature is not available for organizations that have set up multi-geo.
  
> [!NOTE]

### High impact

|App/feature  |Limitation  |Action required  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Deleted sites | Any sites that have been deleted can't be restored after the change. | Before changing your domain name, review the Deleted sites page in the SharePoint admin center and restore any sites that you might want to keep. |
| Multi-Geo configurations | Your SharePoint domain name can't be changed if your organization is currently set up for Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo or was previously set up for it.  | No action available. |
| Point-in-time restoration | Restoring a site to a previous time before the domain name change isn't possible. | No action available.|
| Vanity domain configurations | If your SharePoint domain is, for example, teams.contoso.com (versus contoso.sharepoint.com), your domain name can't be changed. | No action available. |

## Step 1: Add the new domain name

1. Check the availability of the new domain you want by entering the full SharePoint URL in your browser (for example, `https://fabrikam.sharepoint.com`). If you get a “not found” (404) error, it indicates the domain is most likely available. If the domain is already registered by another customer, we can't provide any information or contact the customer. 

    -or-

    If you own the domain for another subscription, you need to [delete that tenant in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-delete-howto). Deleting a tenant typically takes three days to complete and to make the domain available. 

    > [!WARNING]
    > Do NOT use the domain to test this procedure in a test environment first. If you do, you won't be able to use the domain for your production environment.

2. Go to the [Custom domain names page in the Azure AD admin center](https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must use the hyperlink [https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain](https://aka.ms/SPORenameAddDomain). Failure to use this hyperlink will prevent you from successfully adding a custom domain.

3. Select **Add custom domain**.

4. In the **Custom domain name** box, add the full new “.onmicrosoft.com” domain, and then select **Add domain**.

    ![Custom domain name pane](media/custom-domain-name.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When adding the domain, it needs to be an “onmicrosoft.com” domain. For example, if you want to rename your tenant to fabrikam.sharepoint.com, the domain that you enter should be fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com. You do not need to purchase the “onmicrosoft.com” domain to add it and it does not require any public DNS registration.
 
5. Make sure you get a confirmation message. If the domain isn't available, try a different domain. 
 
6. After getting a confirmation that the domain was added successfully, you might see a message that the properties could not be found. Select the message to refresh domain references.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Do NOT add any other domains.
    > Do NOT configure the new domain as the initial domain.
    > If, after adding the domain, you are prompted to create a new TXT record with your domain name registrar, the domain has NOT been added correctly and you will NOT be able to perform a rename. If you are prompted, you will need to delete the invalid domain and return to the previous Step 2.
 
7. Confirm that your domain has been added to the list. 

    ![Domain status verified](media/domain-verified.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The domain name must have the status of "Verified". If the status is NOT "Verified" then you will NOT be able to perform a rename. 

## Step 2: Use Microsoft PowerShell to rename your domain

> [!WARNING]
> Changing your SharePoint domain name might take several hours to days depending on the number of sites and OneDrive users that you have. We strongly recommend that you make this change during a period of low usage (like a weekend) and tell users to avoid accessing SharePoint and OneDrive content during the change. In addition, any actions that create new OneDrives and sites (such as creating a new team or private channel in Microsoft Teams) will be temporarily blocked during the rename. 
  
1. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell".
    > 
    > When installing the latest version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, please refer to the System Requirements and Install Instructions.

2. Connect to SharePoint as a [global admin or SharePoint admin](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

   Example: 

   `Connect-SPOService -Url "https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com"`
    
3. Run the following command to specify the new domain name:
  
    ```PowerShell
    Start-SPOTenantRename -DomainName <DomainName> -ScheduledDateTime <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] 
    ```

    Where "DomainName" is the part before "sharepoint.com" or "onmicrosoft.com" and "ScheduledDateTime" is at least 24 hours in the future, but not more than 30 days. 

    Example: 

    `Start-SPOTenantRename -DomainName "fabrikam" -ScheduledDateTime "2021-12-31T10:25:00"`

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the PowerShell command Start-SPOTenantRename is not found or nothing is returned, ensure that you have installed the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell. If required, before installing the latest version, you might need to uninstall all previous versions by running `Uninstall-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -Force -AllVersions`.

You can get the status of the rename by running `Get-SPOTenantRenameStatus`.

During and after the rename, you can get the state of a site by running `Get-SPOSiteRenameState`. For more info about this cmdlet, see [Get-SPOSiteRenameState](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spositerenamestate).

To cancel a rename that has not started, you can run `Stop-SPOTenantRename`.

## Step 3: Review features and settings after the rename

1. Review any firewall rules that might block access to the new domain.

2. Review organization browser settings to make sure  the new domain is a trusted location. This includes reviewing any Group Policy settings that might control browser settings.

3. Review any third-party apps, custom apps, and scripts that access SharePoint. They might need to be modified to use the new domain.
