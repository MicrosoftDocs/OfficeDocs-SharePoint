# How to think about your modern intranet

These days, there's an abundance of discussions about best practices to modernize your intranet - designing an intranet the new way, in the “modern” way, in the intelligent way - and so on. There aren't many discussions about what modern means as a concept, how modern thinking relates to technology, and how to apply modern principals to your organization's intranet. 

Use this guide to understand how to leverage SharePoint to meet your organization's needs through integrating modern concepts into the design of your intranet, portals, and sites.

## What does modern mean?

In the modern world, the intranet should be the center of your workplace. A modern SharePoint intranet is engaging, informative, personalized, and integrated with the other portals and sites in your intranet as well as other Microsoft 365 apps like Microsoft Teams and Yammer. Modern intranets take many shapes and sizes depending on the ever-evolving needs of the business.

Hallmarks of what constitutes a modern intranet:

- **Rapid deployment**: Adaptable designs can be built using out of the box pages and web parts and no longer solely depends on IT to deploy.

- **Built with the UX in mind**: Accessible design principals are built into the modern experience enabling viewers to securely access the intranet on any device.

- **Personalized experience**: Features like audience targeting, news, the Highlighted Content web part, and the My Feed web part make it easy to dynamically display personalized content.

- **Software as a service**: Updates are automatic, ensuring you are using the latest technology.

## Why invest in the modern approach?

Investing in the modern approach looks different depending on the condition of your current intranet but no matter the path it will require strategic planning and a team to implement changes. By spending resources modernizing your intranet now, you will enable your organization to move faster and more efficiently than before. 

What makes modernizing your intranet worth the effort: 

- **Move at the speed of your business**: Display content dynamically using flexible designs that scale as your business grows.

- **Meet employees where they are**: Target relevant content to specific viewers on any device.

- **Reduce the cost of technical resources**: Security, permissions, sharing, and other governance components can be centrally managed across Microsoft 365 apps.

- **Improves the likelihood of intranet success**: Viewers are more likely to use the intranet when content is relevant, easy to navigate, and mobile.
