# Permission levels in SharePoint

While SharePoint offers a variety of permission levels for sites, we highly recommend using the built-in SharePoint groups for communication sites and managing team site permissions through the associated Microsoft 365 group. This allows for much easier administration. For information about managing permissions in the SharePoint modern experience, see [Sharing and permissions in the SharePoint modern experience](modern-experience-sharing-permissions.md).

## Understanding permission levels

The easiest way to work with permissions is to use the default groups and permissions levels provided, which cover most common scenarios. But, if you need to, you can set more fine-grained permissions beyond the default levels. This article describes the different permissions and permission levels, how SharePoint groups and permissions work together, and how permissions cascade through a site collection.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Want to go straight to the steps for changing or setting permission levels? See [How to create and edit Permission Levels](how-to-create-and-edit-permission-levels.md). 
  
## Overview and permissions inheritance

If you work on a site, you are working inside a site collection. Every site exists in a site collection, which is a group of sites under a single top-level site. The top-level site is called the root site of the site collection.
  
The following illustration of a site collection shows a simple hierarchy of sites, lists and list items. The permissions scopes are numbered, starting at the broadest level at which permissions can be set, and ending at the narrowest level (a single item in a list).
  
![A graphic that shows SharePoint Security scopes at site, subsite, list, and item.](media/b7cf87f3-578c-4605-bb31-9d2ecf88877e.png)
  
 **Inheritance**
  
An important concept to understand is permissions inheritance. By design, all the sites and site content in a collection inherit the permissions settings of the root or top-level site. When you assign unique permissions to sites, libraries, and items, those items no longer inherit permissions from their parent site. Here's more information on how permissions work within the hierarchy:
  
- A site collection administrator configures permissions for the top level site or root site for the whole collection.
    
- If you are a site owner, you can change permission settings for the site, which stops permission inheritance for the site.
    
- Lists and libraries inherit permissions from the site to which they belong. If you are a site owner, you can stop permissions inheritance and change the permission settings for the list or library.
    
- List items and library files inherit permissions from their parent list or library. If you have control of a list or library, you can stop permissions inheritance and change permissions settings directly on a specific item.
    
    It is important to know that a user can interrupt the default permission inheritance for a list or library item by sharing a document or item with someone who does not have access. In that case, SharePoint automatically stops inheritance on the document.
    
## Default Permission Levels
<a name="__toc344968759"> </a>

Default permission levels allow you to quickly and easily provide common levels of permissions for one user or groups of users.
  
You can make changes to any of the default permissions levels, except **Full Control** and **Limited Access**, both of which are described more fully in the following table.
  
|**Permission Level**|**Description**|
|-----|-----|
|Full Control  <br/> |Contains all available SharePoint permissions. By default, this permission level is assigned to the Owners group. It can't be customized or deleted.  <br/> |
|Design  <br/> |Create lists and document libraries, edit pages and apply themes, borders, and style sheets on the site. There is no SharePoint group that is assigned this permission level automatically.  <br/> |
|Edit  <br/> |Add, edit, and delete lists; view, add, update, and delete list items and documents. By default, this permission level is assigned to the Members group.  <br/> |
|Contribute  <br/> |View, add, update, and delete list items and documents.  <br/> |
|Read  <br/> |View pages and items in existing lists and document libraries and download documents.  <br/> |
|Limited Access  <br/> |Enables a user or group to browse to a site page or library to access a specific content item when they do not have permissions to open or edit any other items in the site or library. This level is automatically assigned by SharePoint when you provide access to one specific item. You cannot assign Limited Access permissions directly to a user or group yourself. Instead, when you assign edit or open permissions to the single item, SharePoint automatically assigns Limited Access to other required locations, such as the site or library in which the single item is located. This allows SharePoint to render the user interface correctly and show the user some context around their location in the site. Limited Access does not grant any additional permissions to the user, so they can't see or access any other content. <br/>|
|Web-Only Limited Access <br/> |Web-Only Limited access is a variant of the ‘Limited Access’ permission level which enables users’ access to the web object only.  <br/>|
|Approve  <br/> |Edit and approve pages, list items, and documents. By default, the  *Approvers*  group has this permission.  <br/> |
|Manage Hierarchy  <br/> |Create sites and edit pages, list items, and documents. By default, this permission level is assigned to the  *Hierarchy Managers*  group.  <br/> |
|Restricted Read  <br/> |View pages and documents, but not historical versions or user permissions.  <br/> |
|View Only  <br/> |View pages, items, and documents. Any document that has a server-side file handler can be viewed in the browser but not downloaded. File types that do not have a server-side file handler (cannot be opened in the browser), such as video files and .png files, can still be downloaded.  <br/> |
|||
   
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 subscriptions create a security group called "Everyone except external users" that contains every person you add into the Microsoft 365 directory (except people who you add explicitly as External Users). This security group added to the Members group automatically on Modern Team sites with *Public* privacy settings, so that users in Microsoft 365 can access and edit the SharePoint site. Also, for Modern Team sites created as *Private*, "Everyone except external users" cannot be granted any permissions and people must be explicitly granted permissions.  In addition, Microsoft 365 subscriptions create a security group called "Company Administrators", which contains Microsoft 365 Admins (such as Global and Billing Admins). This security group is added to the Site Collection Administrators group. For more info, see [Default SharePoint groups](./default-sharepoint-groups.md).

By default, site owners and members can add new users to the site.

To learn more about "Everyone except external users" permission, see [Special SharePoint Groups](./default-sharepoint-groups.md#special-sharepoint-groups)
  
## Permission levels and SharePoint groups
<a name="__migbm_0"> </a>

Permission levels work together with SharePoint groups. A SharePoint group is a set of users who all have the same permission level.
  
The way this works is that you put related permissions together into a permission level. Then you assign that permission level to a SharePoint group.
  
![Site permission dialog under Site Settings/Users and Permissions/Site Permissions](media/0ba0a6f9-4787-4088-bb53-6e8ff098cd42.PNG)
  
By default, each kind of SharePoint site includes certain SharePoint groups. For example, a Team Site automatically includes the Owners, Members, and Visitors group. A Publishing Portal site includes those groups and several more, such as Approvers, Designers, Hierarchy Managers, and so on. When you create a site, SharePoint automatically creates a pre-defined set of SharePoint groups for that site. In addition, a SharePoint admin can define custom groups and permission levels.
  
To learn more about SharePoint groups, see [Understanding SharePoint groups](./default-sharepoint-groups.md).
  
The SharePoint groups and permission levels that are included by default in your site may differ, depending on:
  
- The template that you choose for the site
    
- Whether a SharePoint admin created a unique permissions set on the site that has a specific purpose, such as Search
    
The following table describes the default permission levels and associated permissions for three standard groups: Visitors, Members, and Owners.
  
|**Group**|**Permission level**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Visitors** <br/> |**Read** This level includes these permissions:  <br/>  Open  <br/>  View Items, Versions, pages, and Application pages  <br/>  Browse User Information  <br/>  Create Alerts  <br/>  Use Self-Service Site Creation  <br/>  Use Remote Interfaces  <br/>  Use Client Integration Features  <br/> |
|**Members** <br/> |**Edit** This level includes all permissions in Read, plus:  <br/>  View, add, update and delete Items  <br/>  Add, Edit and Delete Lists  <br/>  Delete Versions  <br/>  Browse Directories  <br/>  Edit Personal User Information  <br/>  Manage Personal Views  <br/>  Add , Update, or Remove Personal Web Parts  <br/> |
|**Owners** <br/> |**Full Control** This level includes all available SharePoint permissions.  <br/> |

## Permissions and dependent permissions
<a name="__toc313623995"> </a>

SharePoint permissions can depend on other SharePoint permissions. For example, you must be able to open an item to view it. In this way, View Items permission depends on Open permission.
  
When you select a SharePoint permission that depends on another, SharePoint automatically selects the associated permission. Similarly, when you clear SharePoint permission, SharePoint automatically clears any SharePoint permission that depends on it. For example, when you clear View Items, SharePoint automatically clears Manage Lists (you can't manage a list if you can't view an item).
  
> [!TIP]
> The only SharePoint permission without a dependency is Open. All other SharePoint permissions depend on it. To test a custom permission level, you can just clear "Open". This automatically clears all other permissions. 
  
The following sections contain tables that describe SharePoint permissions for each permission category. For each permission, the table shows the dependent permissions.
  
- [Site permissions and dependent permissions](understanding-permission-levels.md#BKMK_Site_Dependent)
    
- [List permissions and dependent permissions](understanding-permission-levels.md#BKMK_listdependent)
    
- [Personal permissions and dependent permissions](understanding-permission-levels.md#BKMK_personaldependent)

## Lockdown mode
<a name="__toc313623995"> </a>

 *Limited-access user permission lockdown mode*  is a [site collection feature](https://support.office.com/article/A2F2A5C2-093D-4897-8B7F-37F86D83DF04) that you can use to secure published sites. When lockdown mode is turned on, fine-grain permissions for the limited access permission level are reduced. The following table details the default permissions of the limited access permission level and the reduced permissions when the lockdown mode feature is turned on.
  
|**Permission**|**Limited access - default**|**Limited access - lockdown mode**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|List permissions: View Application Pages  <br/> |X  <br/> ||
|Site permissions: Browse User Information  <br/> |X  <br/> |X  <br/> |
|Site permissions: Use Remote Interfaces  <br/> |X  <br/> ||
|Site permissions: Use Client Integration Features  <br/> |X  <br/> |X  <br/> |
|Site permissions: Open  <br/> |X  <br/> |X  <br/> |
   
Lockdown mode is on by default for all publishing sites, including if a legacy publishing site template was applied to the site collection. Lockdown mode is the recommended configuration if greater security on your sites is a requirement.
  
If you disable the limited-access user permission lockdown mode site collection feature, users in the "limited access" permissions level (such as Anonymous Users) can gain access to certain areas of your site. 
  
## Plan your permission strategy
