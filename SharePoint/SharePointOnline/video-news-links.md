## How to publish a Video news link
You can publish videos hosted on SharePoint sites as news posts in the Viva Connections Feed from the **+ New** menu on any SharePoint organizational news site.  
1.  Select the video in OneDrive or SharePoint that you want to publish.

2.  Create a sharing link with the appropriate permissions for the intended viewing audience.

    > Create a sharing link that includes members of your organization that already have access to the video so they can play it.
