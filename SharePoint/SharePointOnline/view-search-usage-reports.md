# View search usage reports

If you're a SharePoint admin in your organization, you're probably asked questions about search usage, such as:
  
- What are the top queries on my site per day or per month?
    
- How many search queries are users performing on average?
    
- Which queries are getting low clicks as they're simply not showing up in any results?
    
- How often are query rules firing and how often are people clicking promoted results?
    
This article describes how you can use search reports in the SharePoint admin center to find answers to these questions.
  
## To view a report
<a name="__top"> </a>

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.
    
3. In the left pane, select **Classic features**.
    
4. Under **Search**, select **Open**.

5. Choose **View Usage Reports**.
    
6. Click a link on the page to retrieve a report. The report opens in an Excel spreadsheet or in another program that you can find online.
