# View search usage reports

>[!NOTE]
>Beginning on December 9, 2020, we'll be retiring classic tenant-wide search usage reports in SharePoint Online.  After this change, you will be able to discover site collection search usage data through the classic site collection usage reports under the **Site** > **Site Settings** > **Site collection Administration** > **Search Reports** where you can access and download usage data for the last 31 days and past 12 months. For administrators of Microsoft Search you can access the tenant usage analytics reports through the Microsoft 365 admin center under **Settings** > **Search and Intelligence** > **Insights**.

If you're a SharePoint admin in your organization, you're probably asked questions about search usage, such as:
  
- What are the top queries on my site per day or per month?
    
- How many search queries are users performing on average?
    
- Which queries are getting low clicks as they're simply not showing up in any results?
    
- How often are query rules firing and how often are people clicking promoted results?
    
This article describes how you can use search reports in the SharePoint admin center to find answers to these questions.
