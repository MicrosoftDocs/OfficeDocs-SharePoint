# What's new in the SharePoint admin center

We're continuously adding new features to the new SharePoint admin center and fixing issues we learn about. Here's a summary of what's included. You can help us improve the admin center by sending us your suggestions and reporting bugs you encounter. In the lower-right corner of the admin center, click the **Feedback** button.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The new SharePoint admin center is supported in Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
> 
> Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the [Targeted release option in Microsoft 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365). This means that you might not yet see some features described in this article.
