# What's new in the SharePoint admin center

We're continuously adding new features to the new SharePoint admin center and fixing issues we learn about. Here's a summary of what's included. You can help us improve the admin center by sending us your suggestions and reporting bugs you encounter. In the lower-right corner of the admin center, click the **Feedback** button.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The new SharePoint admin center is supported in Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. <br>Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the [Targeted release option in Office 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365). This means that you may not yet see some features described in this article.
  
## June 2019

- The new SharePoint admin center is set as the default experience unless you select to open the classic SharePoint admin center by default (on the Settings page).
- On the Active sites page, you can select multiple sites and bulk edit sharing and hub association settings.
- Classic SharePoint admin features such as Term Store, User Profiles, Search, Apps, and more are available from the Classic features page so you can access them directly from the new SharePoint admin center.
