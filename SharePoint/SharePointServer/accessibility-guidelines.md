# Accessibility guidelines for SharePoint Server 

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-xxx-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
SharePoint Server supports the accessibility features of common browsers that help IT Pros administer deployments and access sites. For more information about supported features, see [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
  
Administrators and other users who have administrative responsibilities typically use the SharePoint Central Administration website and the SharePoint Management Shell to manage deployments. The mouse and keyboard are typical devices that administrators use to interact with Central Administration.
  
Because SharePoint Server runs as web sites in Internet Information Services (IIS), administrators and users depend on the accessibility features that browsers provide. SharePoint Server supports the accessibility features of supported browsers. For more information, see [Plan browser support in SharePoint Server 2016 and 2019](install/browser-support-planning-2016-2019.md) and [Plan browser support in SharePoint Server Subscription Edition](install/browser-support-planning-subscription-edition.md).
  
Users who don't use a mouse can use a keyboard to navigate the user interface and complete actions. The ability to use the keyboard in this way is a result of support for keyboard interactions that a browser provides. Users who have devices that support touch can also use gestures to complete operations. For more information, see [Touch](/windows/win32/uxguide/inter-touch).
