# Assign a category page and a catalog item page to a term in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
Category pages and catalog item pages are page layouts that you can use to show structured content consistently across a site. They are often used when displaying catalog content on a site that uses managed navigation. This saves you from having to create many individual pages for content that you want to show in the same manner across your site. You can assign a category page or a catalog item page to all terms in a term set, or to specific terms in a term set. For more information, see "Catalog pages and catalog item pages" in [Overview of cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server](overview-of-cross-site-publishing.md).

> [!NOTE]
>  Because SharePoint Server runs as websites in Internet Information Services (IIS), administrators and users depend on the accessibility features that browsers provide. SharePoint Server supports the accessibility features of supported browsers. For more information, see the following resources: > [Plan browser support](../install/browser-support-planning-2016-2019.md)> [Accessibility guidelines in SharePoint](../accessibility-guidelines.md)> [Accessibility in SharePoint](/sharepoint/dev/general-development/accessibility-in-sharepoint)> [Keyboard shortcuts](https://support.office.com/article/466e33ee-613b-4f47-96bb-1c20f20b1015)> [Touch](/windows/win32/wintouch/windows-touch-gestures-overview).
  
Before you assign a category page and a catalog item page in term store management, verify the following:
  
- The publishing site is using managed navigation. By default, site collections that are created by using the Publishing Portal Site Collection template use managed navigation.
    
- You have created a navigation term set in term store management as described in [Create and manage terms in a term set](../../SharePointOnline/create-and-manage-terms.md).
    
- You have created a category page and a catalog item page.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have connected a publishing site to a catalog and selected to integrate the catalog into the publishing site as described in [Connect a publishing site to a catalog in SharePoint Server](connect-a-publishing-site-to-a-catalog.md), the category page and catalog item page configurations that you specified are displayed in term store management. 
  
## Assign a category page and a catalog item page to a term
<a name="BKMK_Assign"> </a>

By default, when you assign a category page to a term, the page that you specify will also be assigned to the children of the term unless you specify a different page to be used on all the children of a term.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You should only assign catalog item pages to a term if the term set is used as a tagging term set for catalog content.
