A backup is a copy of data that is used to restore and recover that data after a system failure. While backups allow you to restore data after a failure they are also useful to keep for routine purposes. These purposes include copying a database from one server to another, setting up database mirroring, and archiving to comply with regulatory requirements.
  
If you make appropriate backups, you can recover from many system failures, such as the following:
  
- Media failure
    
- User errors (such as deleting a file by mistake)
    
- Hardware failures (such as a damaged hard disk or permanent loss of a server)
    
- Natural disasters
