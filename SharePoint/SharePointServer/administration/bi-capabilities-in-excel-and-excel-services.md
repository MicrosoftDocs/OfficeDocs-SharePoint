## Business intelligence capabilities in Excel 2013
<a name="part1"> </a>

Using Excel 2016, you can create powerful reports, scorecards, and dashboards. You can bring data into Excel, sort, and organize data, and use it to create reports and scorecards. You can also use powerful analytic capabilities in Excel to visualize and explore data. The following table describes business intelligence features in Excel.
  
**Table: Overview of business intelligence capabilities in Excel 2013**

|**Task area**|**Capability**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Get data  <br/> |Native data  <br/> |Native data is data that was imported into Excel and lives in Excel without maintaining an external data connection. This is useful for working with static data, working with data that is updated manually, and creating workbooks that are published in locations where external data connections are not supported.  <br/> |
|Get data  <br/> |External data  <br/> |External data is data that resides on another computer and is accessed in Excel through one or more external data connections. Excel can connect to many kinds of data sources.  <br/> |
|Work with data  <br/> |Data Models  <br/> |A Data Model is a dataset that consists of multiple tables. You can use Data Models to bring together data from different databases and create relationships between tables of data. You can use a Data Model as a source for reports, scorecards, and dashboards. For more information, see [PowerPivot: Powerful data analysis and data modeling in Excel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263500).  <br/> |
|Work with data  <br/> |Flash Fill  <br/> |Flash Fill is functionality that enables you to quickly and easily format data that is displayed in a table in Excel. For example, suppose that you have imported data into Excel and you have a column that lists dates and times, and you only want to use dates. You can insert a new column, type the date that corresponds to the first item in the format that you want to use, and then use Flash Fill to automatically do this for all the rows in your table.  <br/> |
|Create reports  <br/> |Quick Analysis  <br/> |Quick Analysis is functionality that enables you to select a range of data and see recommended ways to visualize that information. When you use Quick Analysis, you can see what your chart or table will resemble before actually selecting which chart type to use.  <br/> |
|Create reports  <br/> |Reports  <br/> |Reports can include tables, line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, radar charts, and many other kinds of charts. You can use Excel to create powerful, interactive PivotChart reports and PivotTable reports to display relevant information by using lots of data sources.  <br/> |
|Create reports  <br/> |Scorecards  <br/> |Scorecards are a special kind of report designed to show whether performance is on- or off-target for one or more metrics at a glance. Scorecards typically contain one or more key performance indicators (KPIs) that compare actual values to target values and use a graphical indicator, such as colors or symbols, to show performance at a glance.  <br/> In Excel, you can use KPIs that were defined in an external database or use Power Pivot to create your own KPIs.  <br/> |
|Create reports  <br/> |Power View  <br/> |Power View is an add-in for Excel that you can use to create highly interactive views. Power View enables you to quickly and easily create reports, scorecards, and dashboards. You can configure connections between items in a view so that values in one report can be used as parameters for other reports in the view. For more information about Power View, see [Power View: Explore, visualize, and present your data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263501).  <br/> |
|Create or edit reports  <br/> |Field List and Field Well  <br/> | When you create a PivotChart or PivotTable report, you use the **Fields** section to specify what information to display in the reports. The Fields section contains the **Field List** and **Field Well**.  <br/>  The **Field List** lists items such as dimensions and members from the data source that you are using for the PivotChart or PivotTable report. You can also use the Field List to determine whether you are using native data or external data.  <br/>  The **Field Well** shows which items from the **Field List** are displayed in the report. You can change what information is displayed in a PivotChart or PivotTable report by selecting (or clearing) different items and measures.  <br/> |
|Apply filters  <br/> |Timeline control  <br/> |The Timeline control is a special kind of time filter that you can use in Excel. To add a timeline control to a worksheet, at least one report on the worksheet must use data that contains a calendar date/time hierarchy. You can use the timeline control to select a single time period or a range of time, and any reports that are connected to the timeline are automatically updated to show information for that time period.  <br/> |
|Apply filters  <br/> |Slicers  <br/> |Slicers are a kind of filter that you can use to select one or more items to use as a filter for reports and scorecards in a worksheet. For example, suppose that you want to see sales information for different colors of items, such as shirts that your company carries. You can create a slicer that lists shirt colors, connect it to a sales report, and then use the slicer to view sales information for the colors that are selected in the slicer.  <br/> |
|Explore and analyze data  <br/> |Quick Explore  <br/> |Quick Explore is functionality that enables you to click a value in a PivotChart or PivotTable report that uses SQL Server Analysis Services data or Power Pivot data, and then see additional information about that value displayed as a chart type. You can also use Quick Explore to drill up (or down) to view higher (or lower) levels of detail in a PivotChart or PivotTable report.  <br/> |
|Use advanced analytic capabilities  <br/> |Calculated Members and Calculated Measures  <br/> |Calculated Members and Calculated Measures are items that you can define by using Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) queries in Excel. You can create calculated members and calculated measures for PivotChart or PivotTable reports that use multidimensional data that is stored in Analysis Services.  <br/> > [!IMPORTANT]> Calculated Members and Calculated Measures are not the same things as Calculated Fields. You can only create Calculated Members and Calculated Measures when you have created a PivotTable report or a PivotChart report that uses data that is stored in Analysis Services. To create calculated members or calculated measures, you should be familiar with the database that you are using and be proficient in writing MDX queries.           |
|Use advanced analytic capabilities  <br/> |Calculated Fields  <br/> |Calculated Fields enable you to change a Data Model that was created by using Power Pivot. When you create Calculated Fields, custom columns are added to the Data Model. You can then use those columns in reports that you create using that Data Model.  <br/> > [!NOTE]> To create calculated fields, you should be familiar with the database that you are using and be proficient in writing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).           |

<a name="part3"> </a>

Office Web Apps Server is the online companion to Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote applications. Office Web Apps Server gives users a browser-based viewing and editing experience by providing a representation of an Office document in the browser. Organizations that have SharePoint Server 2013 might also be using Office Web Apps Server, and that has certain implications for which business intelligence capabilities are supported in a browser window.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization is using Office Web Apps Server together with SharePoint Server 2013, then your organization can use either Office Web Apps Server or SharePoint Server 2013 to display workbooks. This decision affects which business intelligence capabilities are supported in a browser window. > To enable people to interact with workbooks that contain a Data Model or Power View views in a browser window, configure Excel Services in SharePoint Server 2013 to display workbooks. This requires a SharePoint admin to run the **New-SPWOPISupressionSetting** cmdlet on the server where SharePoint Server 2013 in installed. For more information, see [New-SPWOPISuppressionSetting](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/New-SPWOPISuppressionSetting?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).
