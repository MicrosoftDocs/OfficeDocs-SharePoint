# Configure AdventureWorks for Business Intelligence solutions

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
The AdventureWorks sample data set provides a sample database, data warehouse, and OLAP cube. The subsequent articles in this section make use of this sample data to demonstrate Business Intelligence capabilities in Excel, Excel Services in SharePoint Server 2013, and PerformancePoint Services. This article describes how to install and configure the AdventureWorks sample data set and configure a Business Intelligence Center on your SharePoint Server 2013 farm.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This scenario applies only to SharePoint Server 2013 Enterprise. 
  
    
## Scenario overview
<a name="overview"> </a>

Installing the AdventureWorks sample data set consists of downloading the sample data, attaching the sample databases in SQL Server Management Studio, and deploying the sample OLAP cube using the SQL Server Data Tools.
  
Creating a Business Intelligence Center consists of creating a new site collection with the Business Intelligence Center template using the SharePoint Central Administration website.
  
The procedures for completing both of these tasks, plus procedures for configuring the required user access and permissions are included in this article.
  
## Before you begin
<a name="begin"> </a>

Before starting, read the following information about permissions and software requirements:
  
- To deploy the AdventureWorks sample data, you must be a SQL Server and Analysis Services administrator.
    
- To create a Business Intelligence Center, you must be a farm administrator on the SharePoint Server 2013 farm.
    
The subsequent articles make use of Excel Services and PerformancePoint Services. It is assumed that these are configured on your farm. For information about deploying Excel Services, see [Overview of Excel Services in SharePoint Server 2013](excel-services-overview.md) and [Configure Excel Services in SharePoint Server 2013](./configure-excel-services.md). 
  
When using Excel Services or PerformancePoint Services, user access can be provided using Windows Authentication with Kerberos delegation, the Secure Store Service, or, with OLAP data sources, the EffectiveUserName feature. It is assumed that one or more of these options are configured on your farm. For information about configuring Secure Store, see [Plan the Secure Store Service in SharePoint Server](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-server-2010/ee806889(v=office.14)) and [Configure the Secure Store Service in SharePoint Server](configure-the-secure-store-service.md). For information about configuring the EffectiveUserName feature for OLAP data sources, see [Use Analysis Services EffectiveUserName in SharePoint Server](use-analysis-services-effectiveusername-in-sharepoint-server.md).

### Deploy the AdventureWorks sample OLAP cube
<a name="InstallSampleDBs"> </a>

The following requirements must be met before you can deploy the sample OLAP cube. Procedures are provided to accomplish each of these tasks if they have not already been completed in your environment.
  
- The AdventureWorksDW2012 database must be deployed on the SQL Server database engine as covered in the section above.
    
- The SQL Server Data Tools must be installed as part of your SQL Server and Analysis Services deployment.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > SQL Server Data Tools was known as Business Intelligence Developer Studio (BIDS) in previous versions of SQL Server. 
  
- The account running the Analysis Services service must have a login on the SQL Server database engine.
    
If you have not deployed the AdventureWorksDW2012 database, do so now before proceeding with the procedures in this section. 
  
If you have not deployed the SQL Server Data Tools, use the following procedure to deploy them.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can determine if the SQL Server Data Tools are installed by clicking **Start**, **All Programs**, and then **Microsoft SQL Server 2012** on the computer running SQL Server. If the SQL Server Data Tools are installed, it will appear in the menu under **Microsoft SQL Server 2012**. 
  
 **To install the SQL Server Data Tools**
  
1. On the SQL Server 2012 DVD, run setup.exe.
    
2. In the SQL Server Installation Center, on the left pane, click **Installation**.
