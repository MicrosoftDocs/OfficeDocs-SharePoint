# Configure Server-to-Server authentication between publishing and consuming farms

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
When a farm consumes the User Profile service application of a publishing farm, SharePoint issues requests using Server-to-Server authentication on behalf of the user for some features:
  
- Follow a document on a content web application when a user's personal site is located on a web application in an external farm. The content web application makes a OAuth request to the My Sites web application on behalf of the user.

- Create or reply to a site feed post for a site that is located on a content web application but performed through the user's My Site Newsfeed on the My Sites web application. The My Sites web application will make a request of the content web application on behalf of the user to write the post or the reply.

- A User Profile service application task to repopulate the feed cache has to read from the personal site or content site. If the User Profile Service application is running in a different farm, it sends a OAuth request to the My Sites web application or content web application to read the user or site feed data into the cache.
  
## Before you begin
<a name="begin"> </a>

The procedure in this article requires that you already configured the following:

- Shared the User Profile service application between a consuming and a publishing farm as documented in [Share service applications across farms in SharePoint Server](share-service-applications-across-farms.md).
- Configured the Subscription Settings and App Management service applications on both publishing and consuming farms as documented in [section "Configure the Subscription Settings and App Management service applications" of this article](./configure-an-environment-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#configure-the-subscription-settings-and-app-management-service-applications)

Verify that you have the following memberships:

  - **Securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.
  - **db_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.
  - Member of built-in Administrators group on the server on which you are running the PowerShell cmdlets.
    An administrator can use the **Add-SPShellAdmin** cmdlet to grant permissions to use SharePoint Server cmdlets.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have permissions, contact your Setup administrator or SQL Server administrator to request permissions. For additional information about PowerShell permissions, see [Add-SPShellAdmin](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Add-SPShellAdmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true). 

## Configure server-to-server authentication between publishing and consuming farms
<a name="begin"> </a>

The following procedure describes how to configure server-to-server authentication between publishing and consuming farms, and grant just the necessary permissions to allow social features to work. Each farm keeps its own, unique authentication realm.

### Authorize consuming farm to send OAuth requests to the farm hosting the MySites web application

In a SharePoint server in the **farm running the MySites web application** (which might not be the publishing farm), start the SharePoint Management Shell and run this PowerShell script to register the consuming farm as a trusted issuer, get its app principal and grant it the required authorizations:

```powershell
# Register the consuming farm as a trusted issuer using information in its metadata file
$trustedIssuer = New-SPTrustedSecurityTokenIssuer -MetadataEndpoint "https://<ConsumingFarmWinClaimsWebApp>/_layouts/15/metadata/json/1" -Name "<ConsumingFarmFriendlyName>"

# Get the app principal and set required authorizations
$mySiteHost = Get-SPWeb "http://<MySiteHostUrl/"
$appPrincipal = Get-SPAppPrincipal -Site $mySiteHost -NameIdentifier $trustedIssuer.NameId

# Grant permissions AppOnly and Write on the MySite host
Set-SPAppPrincipalPermission -EnableAppOnlyPolicy -Site $mySiteHost -AppPrincipal $appPrincipal -Scope SiteSubscription -Right Write

# Grant permissions Manage on the PrivateAPI and Read on the SocialPermissionProvider
$privateAPITypeId = New-Object -TypeName System.Guid ("a2ccc2e2-1703-4bd9-955f-77b2550d6f0d")
$socialPermissionProviderId = New-Object -TypeName System.Guid ("fcaec196-a98c-4f8f-b60f-e1a82272a6d2")
$mgr = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.SharePoint.SPAppPrincipalPermissionsManager ($mySiteHost)
$mgr.AddSiteSubscriptionPermission($appPrincipal, $privateAPITypeId, [Microsoft.SharePoint.SPAppPrincipalPermissionKind]::Manage)
$mgr.AddSiteSubscriptionPermission($appPrincipal, $socialPermissionProviderId, [Microsoft.SharePoint.SPAppPrincipalPermissionKind]::Read)
```

### Authorize publishing farm to send OAuth requests to the consuming farm

In a SharePoint server in the **consuming farm**, start the SharePoint Management Shell and run this PowerShell script to register the publishing farm as a trusted issuer, get its app principal and grant it the required authorizations:

```powershell
# Register the publishing farm as a trusted issuer using information in its metadata file
$trustedIssuer = New-SPTrustedSecurityTokenIssuer -MetadataEndpoint "https://<PublishingFarmWinClaimsWebApp>/_layouts/15/metadata/json/1" -Name "<PublishingFarmFriendlyName>"

# Get the app principal
$centralAdminWeb = Get-SPWeb "http://<ConsumingFarmCentralAdminURL/"
$appPrincipal = Get-SPAppPrincipal -Site $centralAdminWeb -NameIdentifier $trustedIssuer.NameId

# Grant app only permission and Read on the SiteSubscription
Set-SPAppPrincipalPermission -EnableAppOnlyPolicy -AppPrincipal $appPrincipal -Site $centralAdminWeb -Scope SiteSubscription -Right Read

# Grant permissions Manage on the PrivateAPI
$privateAPITypeId = New-Object -TypeName System.Guid ("a2ccc2e2-1703-4bd9-955f-77b2550d6f0d")
$mgr = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.SharePoint.SPAppPrincipalPermissionsManager ($centralAdminWeb)
$mgr.AddSiteSubscriptionPermission($appPrincipal, $privateAPITypeId, [Microsoft.SharePoint.SPAppPrincipalPermissionKind]::Manage)
```
