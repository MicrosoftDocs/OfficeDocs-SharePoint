# Configure SharePoint Health Analyzer timer jobs in SharePoint Server 2016

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
SharePoint Health Analyzer uses timer jobs to collect health data and then writes the data to the logging folder and to the Logging database. This data is used in reports to display health of the farm servers. You can reschedule these timer jobs, run them immediately, or enable or disable them. 
  
On that page, you can also configure usage data collection, event selection, and usage data collection settings. For more information, see [Configure usage and health data collection in SharePoint Server](configure-usage-and-health-data-collection.md).
  
    
## Use Central Administration to configure health data collection timer jobs
<a name="section1"> </a>

You can use Central Administration to configure health data collection timer jobs.
  
 **To configure health data collection timer jobs by using Central Administration**
  
1. Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Farm Administrators group.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The health data collection timer job settings are farm-wide and cannot be set for individual servers in the farm. 
  
2. In Central Administration, on the home page, select **Monitoring**.
    
3. On the **Monitoring** page, in the **Reporting** section, select **Configure usage and health data collection**.
    
4. On the **Configure usage and health data collection** page, in the **Health Data Collection** section, select **Enable health data collection**.
    
5. In the **Health Data Collection** section, select **Health Logging Schedule**. The **Job Definitions** page opens. It lists all the timer jobs that collect health data. 
    
6. On the **Job Definitions** page, select the timer job that you want to configure. 
    
7. On the **Edit Timer Job** page, in the **Recurring Schedule** section, change the timer job schedule, and then select **OK**.
    
## Use Windows PowerShell to configure health data collection timer jobs
<a name="section2"> </a>

You can configure the health data collection timer job schedule by using PowerShell.
  
 **To configure health data timer jobs by using Windows PowerShell**
  
1. Verify that you have the following memberships:
    
  - **securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance. 
    
  - **db_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated. 
    
  - Administrators group on the server on which you are running the PowerShell cmdlets.
    
  - Add memberships that are required beyond the minimums above.
    
    An administrator can use the **Add-SPShellAdmin** cmdlet to grant permissions. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have permissions, contact your Setup administrator or SQL Server administrator to request permissions. For additional information about PowerShell permissions, see [Add-SPShellAdmin](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Add-SPShellAdmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true). 
  
2. On the **Start** menu, select **All Programs**. 
    
3. Select **SharePoint 2016**.
    
4. Select **SharePoint 2016 Management Shell**.
    
5. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:
    
  ```
  Set-SPTimerJob -Identity <SPTimerJobPipeBind> -Schedule <ScheduleString>
  ```

The value of the **Identity** parameter specifies the timer job. If you do not use the **Identity** parameter, all timer jobs are configured. To see a list of all the timer jobs, type the following command: 
    
  ```
  Get-SPTimerJob | Format-Table -property id,title
  ```

  _\<SPTimerJobPipeBind\>_ can be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a timer job (for example, TimerJob1); or an instance of a valid **SPTimerJob** object. 
    
  Use the value of the **Schedule** parameter to specify the schedule, where  _\<ScheduleString\>_ is one of the following: 
    
  - **Every 5 minutes between 0 and 59**
    
  - **Hourly between 0 and 59**
    
  - **Daily at 15:00:00**
    
  - **Weekly between Fri 22:00:00 and Sun 06:00:00**
    
  - **Monthly at 15 15:00:00**
    
  - **Yearly at Jan 1 15:00:00**
    
    To see examples of timer job schedules, type the following command:
    
  ```
  Get-SPTimerJob | Format-Table -property id,title,schedule
  ```

For more info, see [Get-SPTimerJob](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Get-SPTimerJob?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true) and [Set-SPTimerJob](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Set-SPTimerJob?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true). 
  
> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use Microsoft PowerShell when performing command-line administrative tasks. The Stsadm command-line tool has been deprecated, but is included to support compatibility with previous product versions.
