|[Move site collections between databases in SharePoint Server](move-site-collections-between-databases.md) <br/> |Under some circumstances, you might want to move one or more site collections to a different content database. For example, a site collection can outgrow the content database on which it is located, and you would have to move the site collection to a larger content database. Conversely, if site collections do not grow to their expected capacity, it might be convenient to combine several site collections onto one content database. This article describes how to move site collections between databases.  <br/> |
