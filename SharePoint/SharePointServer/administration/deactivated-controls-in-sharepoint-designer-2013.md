# Deactivated controls in SharePoint Designer 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
A SharePoint Server administrator can deactivate the following features in SharePoint Designer 2013 clients that are connected to the server:
  
- Connections to SharePoint Server if software updates to SharePoint Designer are required.
    
- The ability to create workflows by using the SharePoint Server 2010 workflow platform.
    
- The ability to save and publish existing workflows that use the SharePoint Server 2010 workflow platform.
    
- The ability to save a SharePoint Server 2010 workflow as a template.
    
If you notice that any of these features are not available in SharePoint Designer 2013, contact your SharePoint Server administrator for more information.
