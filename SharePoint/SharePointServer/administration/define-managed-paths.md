# Define managed paths in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
You can specify the paths in the URL namespace of a web application to use for site collections. This is known as a managed path. You can specify that one or more site collections exist at a specified path.
  
There are two types of managed paths that you can create:
  
- A wildcard inclusion allows you to append multiple site collections to the path that you specify. For example, if you add /engineering as a wildcard inclusion off of your root site of http://contoso, then you'll be able to create multiple site collections off of http://contoso/engineering. 
    
- An explicit inclusion allows you to create a single site collection with the specified address. For example, if you add /finance as an explicit inclusion off of your root site of http://contoso, then you'll be able to create a single site collection with the address http://contoso/finance. 
    
Note that the root of a web application is automatically included as an explicit inclusion. Changing the root to a wildcard inclusion is not supported.
  
## Define managed paths for a web application by using Central Administration
<a name="section1"> </a>

Use the procedures that are described here to add or delete managed paths for a web application by using Central Administration.
  
 **To add a managed path by using Central Administration**
  
1. Verify that the user account that is performing this task is a member of the Farm Administrators SharePoint group.
    
2. On the SharePoint Central Administration website, click **Application Management**.
    
3. On the **Application Management** page, click **Manage web applications**.
    
4. Click the web application for which you want to manage paths.
    
    The ribbon becomes active.
    
5. In the **Manage** group of the ribbon, click **Managed Paths**.
    
6. On the **Define Managed Paths** page, in the **Add a New Path** section, type the path to include. 
    
7. Click **Check URL** to confirm that the path does not already exist. 
    
8. In the **Type** list, select either **Wildcard inclusion** or **Explicit inclusion** to identify the type of path. 
    
    The **Wildcard inclusion** type includes all paths that are subordinate to the specified path. The **Explicit inclusion** type includes only the site that is indicated by the specified path. Sites subordinate to the specified path are not included. 
    
9. Click **Add Path**.
    
10. When you have finished adding paths, click **OK**.
    
 **To remove a managed path by using Central Administration**

2. On the SharePoint Central Administration website, click **Application Management**.
    
3. On the **Application Management** page, click **Manage web applications**.
    
4. Click the web application for which you want to manage paths. The ribbon becomes active.
    
5. In the **Manage** group of the ribbon, click **Managed Paths**.
    
6. On the **Define Managed Paths** page, in the **Included Paths** section, click the check box next to the path that you want to remove. 
    
7. Click **Delete selected paths**.
    
    > [!CAUTION]
