## Edit a web application by using Central Administration
<a name="section1"> </a>

Use the procedure described in this section to edit a SharePoint Server web application using the Central Administration.
  
 **To edit a web application by using Central Administration**
  
1. Verify that you have the following administrative credentials:
    
  - To edit a web application, you must be a member of the Farm Administrators SharePoint group.
    
2. Start SharePoint 2016 Central Administration.
    
  - For Windows Server 2008 R2:
    
  - Select **Start**, select **SharePoint 2016**, and then select **SharePoint 2016 Central Administration**.
    
  - For Windows Server 2012:
    
  - On the **Start** screen, select **SharePoint 2016 Central Administration**.
    
    If **SharePoint 2016 Central Administration** is not on the **Start** screen: 
    
  - Right-click **Computer**, select **All apps**, and then select **SharePoint 2016 Central Administration**.
    
    For more info about how to interact with Windows Server 2012, see [Common Management Tasks and Navigation in Windows Server 2012](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831491(v=ws.11)).

5. Select the web application that you want to edit.
    
6. In the ribbon, from the **WEB APPLICATIONS** tab, select **General Settings**, and do the following:
    
  - To change the default time zone for sites that are created on the web application, in the **Default Time Zone** section, from the **Select time zone** dropdown, select a time zone. 
    
  - To change the user settings provider for sites that are created on the web application, in the **User Settings Provider** section, from the **Select User Settings Provider** dropdown, select a user settings provider.
