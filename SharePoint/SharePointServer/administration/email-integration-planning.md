[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
To enable communication in SharePoint Server is a critical component for creating web applications in which group members can interact with each other and keep up with changes to information through the use of alerts. The following site collection features depend on communications being properly set up:
  
- Alerts that notify group members when things have changed.
    
- Administrative messages related to requests for site access and other site administration issues.
    
- Discussion groups.
    
To make the most effective use of the communications features, planning should include understanding the software requirements and maintenance considerations.
