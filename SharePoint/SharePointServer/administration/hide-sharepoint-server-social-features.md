### Hide user interface controls that provide social features in SharePoint Server 2013
<a name="proc3"> </a>

To hide the user interface controls that provide the SharePoint Server 2013 social features, you'll create a custom cascading style sheet (CSS) file and add it to a Master Page. This removes SharePoint Server 2013 social features and replaces them with equivalent Viva Engage features. First, you create a custom CSS file and upload it to the Style Library for your My Site. Then, based on the type of Master Page your site uses, you reference the CSS file in your Master Page by using one of the following methods described in this article:

- Register the CSS file for a custom Master Page

- Register the CSS file for an out-of-box Master Page

> [!NOTE]
> To register the CSS file for a custom Master Page, you have to have Contribute permission on the My Site host site. To register the CSS file for an out-of-box Master Page, you have to be a farm admin to install the required custom delegate control, and you also need Site Owner permissions on the My Site to enable the control for that site.

After you complete these steps, the following changes are applied to the SharePoint Server 2013 social features:

- Removal of the **follow this person** link on another user's **About Me** page.

- Mentioning a user from the profile page ( **About Me**) after the user has filled in the **Ask Me About** field on the user's profile page.

- Following tags from the **#tags I'm Following** page.

- Removal of the **follow multiple people** link from the **People I'm Following page** (mypeople.aspx).

#### Create the HideNewsfeed.css file

1. On your computer, open Notepad.

2. Select **File** > **Save As**.

3. In the **File name** box, enter HideNewsfeed.css.

4. Copy and paste the following code into HideNewsfeed.css:

   ```css
   /* Hide the following SP Social features */
   /* Hide the microfeed div in MySite and team sites */
   #ms-microfeeddiv,
   /* Hide the Followed counts div in MySite */
   .ms-profile-followedCountDiv,
   /* Hide the trending tags div in MySite */
   .ms-mysite-contentBox .ms-mpSearchBox+.ms-webpart-zone,
   /* Hide the follow button on others' About Me page */
   /* Hide the ask me about option on the About Me page */
   #ms-profile-followLinkDiv, .ms-askMeAbout-valuesMoreThanFive, .ms-askMeAbout-valuesFooter,
   .ms-askMeAbout-bulletImage, .ms-askMeAbout-valuesFiveOrLess,
   /* Hide the follow tag option from the landing page */
   .ms-followedTags-followTag,
   /* Hide the follow people option from the landing page */
   .ms-people-followMultiplePeople{
   display:none!important;
   }
   ```

5. Save and close the file.

6. Browse to your My Site Host, then select **Settings** > **Site Contents**.

7. Select **Style Library**.

8. On the ribbon, select the **Files** tab, and then select **Upload Document**.

9. Select **Browse**, locate the HideNewsfeed.css file, and then select **Open**.

10. Select **OK**.

If your My Site uses a custom Master Page, follow the steps in _Register the CSS file for a custom Master Page_. If your My Site uses an out-of-box Master Page, follow the steps in _Register the CSS file for an out-of-box Master Page_.

#### Register the CSS file for a custom Master Page

1. Using a text editor, open the custom Master Page.

2. Copy and paste the following code into the Master Page immediately before the  `</head>` tag:

   ```css
   <SharePoint:CssRegistration ID="HideNewsfeedCssRegistration" Name="<% $SPUrl:~SiteCollection/Style Library/HideNewsfeed.css %>" runat="server" After="corev15.css" />
   ```

3. Save and close the Master Page.

4. Refresh your site to see the changes.

#### Register the CSS file for an out-of-box Master Page

1. Start Visual Studio 2013 with Office Developers Tools for Visual Studio.

2. Select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

3. In the **Installed** pane, expand **Visual C#** > **Office/SharePoint**, then select **SharePoint Solutions**.

4. Select **SharePoint 2013 - Empty Project**.

5. In the **Name** box, enter HideNewsfeed.

6. Select **OK**.

7. In the **SharePoint Customization Wizard**, select the My Site Host site collection to use for debugging.

8. Select **Deploy as a farm solution**, then select **Finish**.

9. Select **Project** > **Add New Item**.

10. In the **Add New Item - HideNewsfeed** dialog box, select **User Control**.

11. In the **Name** box, enter HideNewsfeed.ascx, then select **Add**.

12. Copy and paste the following line at the end of HideNewsfeed.ascx

    ```css
    <SharePoint:CssRegistration ID="HideNewsfeedCssRegistration" Name="<% $SPUrl:~SiteCollection/Style Library/HideNewsfeed.css %>" runat="server" After="corev15.css" />
    ```

13. Save the HideNewsfeed.ascx file.

14. Select **Project** > **Add New Item**.

15. In the **Add New Item - HideNewsfeed** dialog, select **Empty Element**.

16. In the **Name** box, enter HideNewsfeed, then select **Add**.

17. In the Elements.xml file, press Ctrl+A, then press Delete.

18. Copy and paste the following XML in the Elements.xml file:

    ```css
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Elements xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/sharepoint/">
    <Control Id="AdditionalPageHead" ControlSrc="~/_CONTROLTEMPLATES/15/HideNewsfeed/HideNewsfeed.ascx" />
    </Elements>
    ```

19. Save the Elements.xml file.

20. Select **Build** > **Deploy Solution**.

    The control has to be deployed on each web server in the farm. For information about how to deploy and install a solution to the farm, see [Add-SPSolution](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Add-SPSolution?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true) and [Install-SPSolution](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Install-SPSolution?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

    The result is a SharePoint solution package that can be deployed and activated on the My Site Host site.

21. To activate the feature, browse to your My Site Host site, select **Settings** > **Site Settings**.

22. On the **Site Settings** page, in the **Site Actions** section, select **Manage site features**.

23. Locate the **HideNewsfeed Feature1**, and select **Activate**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Instead of uploading the HideNewsfeed.css to the Style Library, you can create the CSS file in the SharePoint Solution package so that it is deployed together with the solution.

24. Browse to the **Newsfeed** page to check that the controls are no longer shown on the page.
