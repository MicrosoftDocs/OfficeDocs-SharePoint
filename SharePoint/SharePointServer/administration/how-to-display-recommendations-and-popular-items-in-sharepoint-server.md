# How to display recommendations and popular items in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md.md)]
  
This series of articles explains how to use the Usage analytics feature that was introduced in SharePoint Server to display "smart content" on your website. By "smart content" we mean content such as recommendations and popular items.
  
-  *Recommendations*  are based on how other visitors have interacted with your website. For example, on a product page, you can display "People who viewed this product also viewed  *\<other products\>*  ." 
    
-  *Popular items*  are the most frequently viewed items on the whole site, or in a specific category. For example, the most viewed laptops on a site that sells technology products. 
    
To help explain, we'll use examples from a fictitious company called Contoso. Here's what the website will look like when it is finished.

> The examples in this series are based on an on-premises SharePoint Server deployment.
