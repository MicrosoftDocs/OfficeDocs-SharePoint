# Integrate a new Yammer network into SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md.md)]
  
This scenario describes the prerequisites and recommended steps to integrate a new Yammer Enterprise network together with your existing SharePoint Server environment.
  
## Scenario prerequisites

For this scenario, we assume that:
  
- You have SharePoint Server 2019, SharePoint Server 2016, or SharePoint Server 2013 SP1 or later installed.
    
- You don't use the SharePoint Server Newsfeed social feature.
    
- You use Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) as your identity provider and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0 for identity federation.
    
- You are ready to use a Yammer Enterprise network.
    
## Step 1: Purchase Yammer Enterprise

Yammer Enterprise is included in many Office 365 plans, which means that you might already have licenses for the service. 
  
## Step 2: Create your Yammer network

To set up a Yammer network, see [Yammer admin help](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/yammer/yammer-landing-page.md).
  
When you set up your network, [enforce Office 365 identity for Yammer users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875042).
  
For information about how users are managed in Yammer Enterprise, see [Manage Yammer users across their life cycle from Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875043).
  
## Step 3: Set up directory synchronization

Office 365 uses Azure Active Directory for identity management, and Yammer Enterprise can be set up to enforce Office 365 identity. If you're using an on-premises directory, in order to manage users in one place, you need to sync your on-premises directory with Azure Active Directory by using Azure Active Directory Connect. 
  
For more information, see [Plan for directory synchronization for Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875044) and [Integrate your on-premises directories with Azure Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=869669).
  
## Step 4: Disable default SharePoint Server social features

After you set up directory synchronization, [disable the default SharePoint Server social features](hide-sharepoint-server-social-features.md).
    
## Step 5: Use Yammer Embed

After you disable the default SharePoint Server social features, you should [use the Yammer embed widget](add-the-yammer-embed-widget-to-a-sharepoint-page.md) to include Yammer feeds on SharePoint pages.
