# Integrate a Yammer network into SharePoint Server and Microsoft 365

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
This scenario describes the prerequisites and recommended steps to integrate a Yammer network together with your SharePoint Server environment and your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise or Microsoft 365 Apps for business.
  
## Scenario prerequisites

For this scenario, we assume that you have:
  
- SharePoint Server 2019, SharePoint Server 2016, or SharePoint Server 2013 SP1 or later installed.
    
- An existing Microsoft 365 organization and a Yammer network.
    
- Enabled Yammer as the Microsoft 365 social experience in the classic SharePoint admin center.
    
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) as your identity provider, and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0 for identity federation.
    
- Already established directory synchronization with Microsoft 365. 
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Planning your user management is fundamental to deploying Microsoft 365 and Yammer Enterprise. To understand how user management works, it's important to understand that Microsoft 365 uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory to provide authentication to Microsoft 365 services, including Yammer Enterprise. This means Microsoft 365 uses the identity that is synchronized with Azure AD to provide authentication. 
  
## Step 1: Configure directory synchronization

You probably have already set up directory synchronization for Microsoft 365 and your on-premises directory. If not, sync your on-premises directory with Azure Active Directory by using Azure Active Directory Connect. 
  
For more info, see [Plan for directory synchronization for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-for-directory-synchronization) and [Integrate your on-premises directories with Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity).

## Step 2: Use Yammer Embed

[Use the Yammer embed widget](add-the-yammer-embed-widget-to-a-sharepoint-page.md) to include Yammer feeds on SharePoint pages.
