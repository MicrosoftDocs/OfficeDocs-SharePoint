# Manage anonymous access for a web application in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
You can enable or disable anonymous access for a web application. If you enable anonymous access for a web application, site administrators can then grant or deny anonymous access at the site collection, site, or item level. If anonymous access is disabled for a web application, no sites within that web application can be accessed by anonymous users. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Both classic and modern experience sites support anonymous access.

The following permission policies can be specified for anonymous users:
  
- **None:** No policy is specified. This setting gives anonymous users the same default permissions available to NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users and All Authenticated Users. 
    
- **Deny Write:** This setting enables anonymous users to read all content within the site collections in a web application. You can then restrict the Read access by site collection, site, or item. 
    
- **Deny All:** Anonymous users have no access to any part of the web application. 
    
Use the following procedure to configure anonymous access for a web application.
