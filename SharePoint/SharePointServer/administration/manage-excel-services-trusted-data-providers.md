Trusted data providers are data providers from which Excel Services accesses data. A data provider is a database type combined with a protocol for accessing data (for example, SQL Server combined with ODBC). 
  
- Excel Services does not access data that does not come from a trusted data provider.
    
- Excel Services contains entries for common data providers. Add additional data providers as needed.
