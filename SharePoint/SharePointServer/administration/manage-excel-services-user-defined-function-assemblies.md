# Manage Excel Services user defined function assemblies (SharePoint Server 2013)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps in this article apply to SharePoint Server 2013 Enterprise. 
  
If your deployment scenarios include workbooks that contain user-defined functions to extend the capabilities of Excel Calculation Services, you must register the user-defined function assemblies on the Excel Services user-defined function assembly list.
  
Before you begin this operation, review the following information about prerequisites:
  
- To use user-defined functions, you must enable user-defined functions on trusted file locations that contain workbooks that require access to user-defined functions. For information about configuring trusted file locations, see [Configure a trusted file location](manage-excel-services-trusted-file-locations.md#proc2).
    
- You must be a member of the Farm Administrators group or an Excel Services service application administrator to perform the procedures in this article.
    
    
## Register a user-defined function assembly

Use the following procedure to register a user-defined function assembly for use with Excel Services.
  
 **To register a user-defined function assembly**
  
1. On the SharePoint Central Administration website home page, in the **Application Management** section, click **Manage service applications**.
    
2. On the Manage Service Applications page, click the Excel Services service application that you want to manage.
    
3. On the Manage Excel Services page, click **User Defined Function Assemblies**.
    
4. On the Excel Services User Defined Functions page, click **Add User-Defined Function Assembly**.
    
5. On the Add User-Defined Function Assembly page, in the **Assembly** section, type the assembly name or the full path of an assembly that contains the user-defined functions, which you want to call in the **Assembly** box. 
    
6. Under **Assembly Location**, select one of the following:
    
  - **Global assembly cache** (a global place where signed assemblies can be deployed and run with full trust by default) 
    
  - **File path** (a local or network file location) 
    
7. In the **Enable Assembly** section, select the **Assembly enabled** check box to enable Excel Calculation Services to call the assembly. You can clear the check box to disable the assembly without removing the function assembly from the list.
