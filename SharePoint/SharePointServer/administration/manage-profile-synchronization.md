Profile Synchronization in SharePoint Server enables User Profile service administrators to synchronize user and group profile information that is stored in the SharePoint Server profile store with profile information that is stored in directory services and business systems across the enterprise.
  
The following articles provide information about how to configure and perform profile synchronization. These articles refer to scenarios using SharePoint Active Directory Import. If you're using Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM), see the MIM documentation.
