# Move or rename service application databases in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

Learn how to move or rename service application databases in SharePoint Server.

The main reason to move service application databases to another farm database server is to load balance the farm. Or you might need to move it to newer hardware.

Renaming service application databases is often done to remove the GUID from the database name after you've used SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard and SharePoint Server Product Configuration Wizard to create the service application databases in your farm. You might also need to align the database names with your organization's naming standards.

Both moving and renaming service application databases follow the same basic process, but there are a few more steps when you are moving service application databases.

1. Move or rename SharePoint Server service application databases using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or Microsoft PowerShell.

2. Point the SharePoint service application to the moved or renamed database using either the SharePoint Central Administration website or PowerShell.

   Depending on how many service application databases you move or rename, pointing the service application to the database can be complex. Different service applications require different methods to point to the moved or renamed database.

These service application databases use the following steps:

- App Management Service

- Managed Metadata Service

- PerformancePoint Service

- Secure Store Service

- SharePoint Translation Service

- State Service

- Subscription Settings Service

- Word Automation Services

1. Stop or disable the service application.

2. Detach the database.

3. Move or rename the database.

4. Attach the database.

5. Point the service application to the moved or renamed database.

6. Restart the service application.

The Business Data Connectivity Service and User Profile Service applications databases require the following steps to move or rename the databases:

1. Stop or disable the service application.

2. Detach the database.

3. Move or rename the database.

4. Attach the database.

5. Point the service application to the moved or renamed database.

6. Delete the service application.

7. Recreate the service application.

8. Restart the service application.

The Search Service application databases require the following steps:

1. Pause the service application.

2. Set the Search service application to Read-Only.

3. Backup the service application.

4. Set the max degree of parallelism to 1 in the new server that hosts SQL Server.

5. Restore the Search service application to a new database server.

6. Set the Search Service application to read/write.

7. Start the service application.

8. Point the Search service application to the moved or renamed databases.

## General steps to move or rename service application databases by using SQL Server
<a name="General"> </a>

To move a service application database, you must use SQL Server. To rename a service application database, you must use SQL Server and File Explorer.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't attempt to move and rename a database in one procedure. You should either move a database or rename a database, not perform both actions at the same time.

When you move or rename service application databases, the first step is to stop the service application for the database that you are changing. You can stop or start services by using Central Administration or PowerShell.

### Step 1: To stop the service application by using Central Administration

1. Use an account that is a member of the Farm Administrators SharePoint group.

2. In Central Administration click **System Settings**.

3. On the System Settings page, in the **Servers** section, click **Manage services on server**.

4. Find the service application that you want to stop, click **Stop** or **Disable** in the **Action** column for the service, and then click **OK**.

### To stop a service by using PowerShell

1. Use an account with these memberships:

   - **securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.

   - **db_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.

   - Administrators group on the server on which you are running the PowerShell cmdlets.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For additional information about Microsoft PowerShell permissions, see [Permissions](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/add-spshelladmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

2. Start the SharePoint Management Shell.

3. You need to know the service GUID for the next step. Use the **Get-SPServiceInstance** cmdlet to retrieve a list of all services in the farm together with their GUIDs.

4. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:

   ```powershell
   Stop-SPServiceInstance -Identity <ServiceGUID>
   ```

   Where  _\<ServiceGUID\>_ is the GUID of the service.

   For more information, see [Stop-SPServiceInstance](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Stop-SPServiceInstance?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

### Move a database by using SQL Server Management Studio and File Explorer
<a name="MoveFull"> </a>

Moving a database requires that you first detach the database from the SQL Server, move the files to the new location by using File Explorer, and then attach the database to the new instance of SQL Server.

#### Step 2: To detach a database from SQL Server

1. Use an account that has the **db_owner** fixed database role for all of the databases that you're moving.

2. In SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the SQL Server instance that the service application database is attached to, and then expand the **Databases** node.

3. Right-click the database, point to **Tasks**, and then click **Detach**. Repeat this step for each database that you want to move.

#### Step 3: To move the database files to a new location by using File Explorer

1. Use an account that has read permission on the source location and write permission on the target location.

2. In File Explorer, find the .mdf, .ndf, and .ldf files for the service application databases and select the ones you want to move. The database files are typically found here,  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.MSSQLServer\MSSQL\Data`

3. Either copy or move the database files to the new location.

#### Step 4: To attach a database to a new instance of SQL Server

1. Use an account that has the **db_owner** fixed database role for all of the databases that you're moving.

2. In SQL Server Management Studio, open the destination SQL Server instance.

3. Right-click the **Databases** node, point to **Tasks**, and then click **Attach**.

4. In the **Attach Database** dialog, browse to where you moved the .mdf, .ndf, and .ldf files, select the .mdf file for the database that you want to attach, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for each database that you're moving.

### Rename a database by using SQL Server Management Studio
<a name="MoveFull"> </a>

Renaming a service application database is a two step process, first stop the service, just as if you were going to move the database. You then rename the database by using SQL Server Management Studio.

 **Step 3: To rename a database by using SQL Server**

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the source SQL Server instance, and then expand the **Databases** node.

2. Right-click the database that you want to rename, click **Rename**, and then type the new name. Repeat this step for each database that you're renaming.

### Point a SharePoint Server service application to a moved or renamed database
<a name="MoveFull"> </a>

Pointing to the moved or renamed database is the next step. You can do this with either Central Administration or PowerShell. Using Central Administration to point service applications to the moved or renamed databases is the same for most of the SharePoint Server service applications. Using PowerShell to point service applications to the moved or renamed databases differs for each service application. This section provides guidance for each service application and database.

#### Step 5: To point the service application to a moved or renamed database by using Central Administration

1. Use an account that is a member of the Farm Administrators SharePoint group.

2. In Central Administration, under **Application Management**, click **Manage service applications**.

3. On the Manage Service application page, click the empty area in the row next to the service application name. The ribbon becomes active, click **Properties** and the **Edit Service Application** dialog appears.

4. Change the database server or database name, and then click **OK**.

#### To point the Managed Metadata service application to a moved or renamed database by using PowerShell

1. Use an account with these memberships:

   - **securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.

   - **db_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.

   - Administrators group on the server on which you are running the PowerShell cmdlets.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For additional information about Microsoft PowerShell permissions, see [Permissions](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/add-spshelladmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

2. Start the SharePoint Management Shell.

3. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:

   ```powershell
   $app = Get-SPServiceApplication -Name "<ServiceApplicationName>"
   Set-SPMetadataServiceApplication -Identity "<Name/GUID of service application>" $app -DatabaseName "<DatabaseName>" -DatabaseCredentials PSCredential object>
   ```

   Where:

   - _\<ServiceApplicationName\>_ is the name of the Managed Metadata service application.

   - _\<DatabaseName\>_ is the name of the renamed database.

#### To point the PerformancePoint service application to a renamed or moved database by using PowerShell

1. Use an account with these memberships:

   - **securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.

   - **db_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.

   - Administrators group on the server on which you are running the PowerShell cmdlets.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For additional information about Microsoft PowerShell permissions, see [Permissions](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/add-spshelladmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

2. Start the SharePoint Management Shell.

3. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-SPPerformancePointServiceApplication -Identity "<ServiceApplicationName>" -SettingsDatabase "<DatabaseServerName\DatabaseName>"
   ```

   Where:

   - _\<ServiceApplicationName\>_ is the name of the PerformancePoint service application.

   - _\<DatabaseServerName\DatabaseName\>_ is the location of and the name of the renamed or moved database. Do not include the location if you are just renaming the database.

The State Service database stores temporary state information data. You can use PowerShell to point the State Service service application to a moved database by performing one of the following procedures:

- Add a new database in the new location, or create a database with a new name. Then add the new database to the service application, and delete the old database. For details, see [To add a new database to the State service application, and remove an old database by using Microsoft PowerShell](#NewDB).

- Dismount the old database, move it by using SQL Server, and then remount the State Service database. For details, see [To point the State service application to a moved database by using Microsoft PowerShell](#PS).

    The following procedures all include the steps shown in the bullet list. So, they do not require that these steps are already performed:

  - Stopping a service application

  - Moving a database by using SQL Server Management Studio and Windows

<a name="Search20132016"> </a>

To move the Search service application databases, you must use SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio, and Windows Explorer. To point to the moved databases, you must use PowerShell. Complete the following steps in the listed order.

 **Important:**

The account, or accounts, that you use to do the operations must have these memberships and permissions:

- Member of the Farm Administrators SharePoint group.

- Member of the Administrators group on the local server.

- Read permission on the source location and write permission on the target location.

- **db_owner** fixed database role for all of the databases that you are moving.

- **db_creator** and **securityadmin** roles for all of the databases that you are moving.

The Search Service account must have the following roles:

- **db_owner** fixed database role on the Administration, Link, and Crawl databases.

- **SPSearchDBAdmin** database role on the Analytics Reporting database.

In some environments, you must coordinate the rename and move procedures with the database administrator. Be sure to follow applicable policies and guidelines for managing databases.

### To pause the Search service application by using PowerShell

1. Start the SharePoint Management Shell.

2. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:

   ```powershell

## Steps to move or rename the Search Service application databases in SharePoint Server 2019
<a name="Search2019"> </a>

To move the Search service application databases, you must use SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio, and Windows Explorer. To point to the moved databases, you must use PowerShell. Complete the following steps in the listed order.

 **Important:**

The account, or accounts, that you use to do the operations must have these memberships and permissions:

- Member of the Farm Administrators SharePoint group.

- Member of the Administrators group on the local server.

- Read permission on the source location and write permission on the target location.

- **db_owner** fixed database role for all of the databases that you are moving.

- **db_creator** and **securityadmin** roles for all of the databases that you are moving.

The Search Service account must have the following roles:

- **db_owner** fixed database role on the Administration, Link, and Crawl databases.

- **SPSearchDBAdmin** database role on the Analytics Reporting database.

In some environments, you must coordinate the rename and move procedures with the database administrator. Be sure to follow applicable policies and guidelines for managing databases.

### To pause the Search service application by using PowerShell

1. Start the SharePoint Management Shell.

2. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:

   ```powershell
   $ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication <SearchServiceApplicationName>
   Suspend-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication -Identity $ssa
   ```

   Where  _\<SearchServiceApplicationName\>_ is the name of the Search service application associated with the database move.

### <a name="ReadOnly"></a>To change the read-only mode for Search service application databases

1. Use an account that is a member of the **db_owner** fixed database role for the content database.

2. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the database server.

3. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**.

4. Set the following databases to read-only mode:

   - Search Administration

   - Analytics Reporting

   - Crawl

   - Link

   - Right-click the database that you want to set to read/write or read-only, and then click **Properties**.

   - In the **Database Properties** dialog, on the **Options** properties page, in the **State** section, select **True** or **False** in the list next to Database Read-Only, and then click **OK**.

   - Click **Yes**.

### To back up the Search service application databases

1. Use an account that is a member of the SQL Server **db_backupoperator** fixed database role on the database server where each database is stored.

2. Start SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the database server where the Search service application databases are stored.

3. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**.

4. Right-click the database that you want to back up, point to **Tasks**, and then click **Back Up**.

5. In the **Back Up Database** dialog, in the **Source** area, select the kind of backup that you want to perform from the **Backup type** list.

    For more information about the type of backup to use, see [Recovery Models (SQL Server)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/recovery-models-sql-server?viewFallbackFrom=sql-server-2014).

6. In the **Backup component** area, click **Database**.

7. Either use the default name or specify a name for the backup set in the **Name** box.

8. Specify the expiration date for the backup set.

    This date determines when the backup set can be overwritten by subsequent backups that have the same name. By default, the backup set is set to never expire (0 days).

9. In the **Destination** area, specify where you want to store the backup.

10. Click **OK** to back up the database.

11. Repeat steps 1-10 for the following databases:

    - Search Administration

    - Analytics Reporting

    - Crawl

    - Link

### To set the value of max degree of parallelism to 1 in the new server that hosts SQL Server

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the new server that hosts SQL Server where you'll move the Search service application databases.

2. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the database server and then click **Properties**.

3. Click **Advanced**.

4. In the **Max Degree of Parallelism** box, select **1** to limit the number of processors to use in parallel plan execution.
