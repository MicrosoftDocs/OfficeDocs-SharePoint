# Outgoing SMTP support for client certificate authentication

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]


Some SMTP servers may require the use of client certificates for authentication before accepting email messages. SharePoint now supports client certificate authentication when sending emails to an SMTP server. The outbound SMTP settings in SharePoint must be configured to use TLS connection encryption and a certificate must be assigned to use this capability. The certificate must be in SharePoint's End Entity certificate store, the certificate's private key must be imported, and the certificate's enhanced key usage extension must specify the certificate is valid for client authentication if that extension is present.

A `-Certificate <SPServerCertificatePipeBind>` parameter has been added to the following cmdlet parameter set:

```powershell
Set-SPWebApplication [-Identity] <SPWebApplicationPipeBind> -SMTPServer <String> [-Certificate <SPServerCertificatePipeBind>] [-DisableSMTPEncryption] [-Force] [-NotProvisionGlobally] [-OutgoingEmailAddress <String>] [-ReplyToEmailAddress <String>] [-SMTPServerPort <Int32>] [-SMTPCredentials <PSCredential>]
```

To assign a certificate to the outbound SMTP settings through Central Administration, set Use TLS connection encryption and Use client certificate authentication to **Yes**, and then select the client certificate from the **Client certificate** drop-down list.
