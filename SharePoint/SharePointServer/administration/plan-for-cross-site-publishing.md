# Plan for cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md.md)] 
  
Cross-Site Collection Publishing is a SharePoint Server feature that enables you to use one or more site collections to author content, and one or more site collections to control the design of the site and the display of the content. The functionality provided by this feature is referred to as cross-site publishing. You can use cross-site publishing to create branded Internet, intranet, and extranet publishing sites. Cross-site publishing is available only in SharePoint Server 2016.
  
There are many planning steps that you must follow to build a solution that uses cross-site publishing. The first articles in this section explain key concepts about cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server, and describe how to plan the architecture to support it. Additional articles in this section divide the remaining planning steps into three tasks, which are based on the three major components of cross-site publishing: planning the authoring site collection, planning the publishing site collection, and planning for search.
