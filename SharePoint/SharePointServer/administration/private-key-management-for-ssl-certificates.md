# Private key management for SSL certificates

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

To better support least privileges scenarios and minimize the permissions given to certificate private keys, SharePoint Server Subscription Edition Version 23H1 applies more granular and sophisticated permission management for these private keys. The permissions will be based on the certificate assignments and will be dynamically updated when the certificate assignments change.

For example, if a certificate is assigned to perform client certificate authentication to an Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, SharePoint will ensure the process thatâ€™s connecting to the SMTP server has the necessary permissions to use the private key of that certificate. If a certificate is no longer assigned to perform client certificate authentication to an SMTP server, SharePoint will remove permissions for that process so it no longer has access to the private key of that certificate.

The following APIs has been added
*Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.CertificateManagement.SPServerCertificate* class to allow third-party integration with this functionality.
