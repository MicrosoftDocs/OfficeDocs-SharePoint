# Profile schema reference in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
When you run the BackupMonitoringSettings.ps1 Microsoft PowerShell script on a SharePoint farm, you create a file that's called a Profile. The Profile follows an XML schema. You can modify settings of elements of the schema to create a custom Profile. You can then use the custom Profile to automate configuration of the monitoring settings in a SharePoint environment. For an introduction to scripted monitoring configuration, see [Overview of scripted monitoring configuration in SharePoint Server](overview-of-scripted-monitoring-configuration.md).
  
Administrators can run the scripts before, during, and after changes to the farm, such as farm topology, major security changes, applying software updates, or running a performance test. The scripts alter the monitoring settings so that all of the necessary monitoring data are collected during the event without flooding the Logging database during normal operation.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must download the PowerShell scripts to back up, restore, or modify the farm monitoring settings. The scripts are available on the TechNet Gallery at [Scripted Monitoring Configuration - BackupMonitoringSettings](/samples/browse/?redirectedfrom=TechNet-Gallery) and [Scripted Monitoring Configuration - AlterMonitoringSettings](/samples/browse/?redirectedfrom=TechNet-Gallery). The **BackupMonitoringSettings.ps1** PowerShell script creates the backup Profile from which you can create other Profiles. 
  
You can create one or more Profiles to adjust the level of monitoring during different phases of the SharePoint lifecycle. You can also use a custom Profile to configure monitoring on several farms at once.
  
You would typically create Profiles for the following purposes:
  
- To complete the configuration of the monitoring settings on a farm after you install SharePoint Server
    
- To change the monitoring settings on a farm just before an administrative change, such as changing the settings of a Search service application on the farm
    
    As a result, you can capture more monitoring data related to that change and suppress unwanted monitoring data. Then you can return the monitoring settings to the original values after the change has been completed.
    
- To restore the monitoring settings on a farm after some administrative change
    
- To restore a previous set of monitoring settings on a farm
    
    You might do this if you are making manual adjustments to the settings and decide that you want to restore the previous settings.
    
- To restore the default settings
    
- To create a profile that you can apply to multiple farms
    
## Backing up the original settings

You should always back up the default monitoring settings before altering them. That way, you can restore those settings should you need to. The backup Profile also can serve as the beginning point for the other Profiles you will create. For more information about how to back up the settings, see [Run scripted monitoring configuration in SharePoint Server](run-scripted-monitoring-configuration.md).
  
## Understanding the Profile schema

When you run the **BackupMonitoringSettings.ps1** PowerShell script, you create a Profile that conforms to the following XML schema. The elements of the file contain the associated monitoring settings from the farm. 
  
```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<Configuration>
  <FarmDiagnosticConfig />
  <UsageServices>
    <UsageService />  
  </UsageServices>
  <UsageDefinitions>
    <UsageDefinition />
  </UsageDefinitions>
  <LogLevels>
    <LogLevel />
  </LogLevels>
  <TimerJobs>
    <TimerJob />
  </TimerJobs>
  <HealthAnalyzerRules>
    <HealthAnalyzerRule />
  </HealthAnalyzerRules>
</Configuration>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the following tables, you cannot change values in fields that are marked as Read-Only. If you change values in Read-Only fields in your Profiles, unpredictable results may occur.

## Create Profiles

You can create an unlimited number of Profiles as. Each Profile might be used for a different purpose, such as to increase the levels of monitoring before a specific change to the environment, or to lower the levels after a change. 
  
You only need to create profile entries for the specific changes that you want to make. The other settings will remain unchanged. For example, if you want to change a few LogLevel settings, then you only need to specify those settings in the Profile. Settings that are not specified in the Profile will not be changed.
  
You might want to use a naming convention for your Profiles so that you can organize them and more easily use them.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always back up the monitoring settings before making any changes to them. Always work from a copy of the backup Profile and never from the original backup file itself.
