# Manage service applications in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
SharePoint Server includes a set of service applications that you can use to share services across web applications. In some cases, you can also share service applications across farms. You can manage service applications by using the SharePoint Central Administration website or by using Windows PowerShell 3.0.

- [Assign or remove administrators of service applications in SharePoint Server](assign-or-remove-administrators-of-service-applications.md)
    
- [Delete a service application in SharePoint Server](delete-a-service-application.md)
