# Plan service deployment in SharePoint Server

## About Services on Server
<a name="Section3"> </a>

The **Services on Server** page in Central Administration lists services that are started or stopped on specific servers in the farm. Some of these services are associated with service applications. After deploying service applications to the farm, go to the Services on Server page and make sure that the associated services are started on the appropriate servers. Some of these services are not associated with service applications. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Note: Search components are deployed by using PowerShell instead of the **Services on Server** page. 
  
After planning the farm topology, use this article to make sure that the appropriate services on server are started for each server in the farm. This may not be necessary for small farms in which all of the service applications and services are run on one server or two redundant servers. 
  
This article lists recommended configuration of services and service applications for two different architecture approaches:
  
- **Streamlined topologies** — The distribution of services and other components in a farm is intended to maximize system resources of server hardware. Streamlined architectures include Front-end servers, Application servers, Search servers, Distributedand database servers. 
    
- **Traditional topologies** — Topologies are based on traditional approaches to building architectures with Web servers, application servers, and database servers. 
    
For more information about these SharePoint 2013 topology approaches, see the following models:
  
- [Streamlined Topologies for SharePoint Server 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=286786)
    
- [Traditional Topologies for SharePoint Server 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=257303)

It typically runs on one or more application servers. It starts one or more worker processes to perform conversions. When actively converting, a worker process may use up a complete processor core. Memory usage depends on the size and content of files being converted. You can use Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets to control the number of worker processes that are used. Several other configuration options are also available through Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets.  <br/> |

||Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Incoming E-Mail  <br/> |Application servers  <br/> |Typically, this service runs on a web server. If you have to isolate this service, you can start it on an application server.  <br/> |
||Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Sandboxed Code Service  <br/> |Front-end servers  <br/> |Start this service on computers that run sandboxed code in the farm. This can include front-end servers and batch-processing servers. This service runs code that is deployed as part of a sandboxed solution in a remote, rights-restricted process and measures the server resources that are used during execution against a site collection-scoped, daily quota.  <br/> |
||Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Web Application  <br/> |Front-end servers, batch-processing servers, plus the Distributed Cache and Request Management servers if these servers are implemented  <br/> |This service provides web server functionality. It is started by default on web servers. Custom features scoped to web applications may not display in Central Administration as intended if this service is not started on the server running Central Administration and if the feature cannot be deployed globally.  <br/> |
||Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Workflow Timer Service  <br/> |Application server  <br/> |This service is automatically configured to run on all web servers in a farm.  <br/> |
