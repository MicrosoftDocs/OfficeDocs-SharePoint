# Set up and configure Access Services 2010 for web databases in SharePoint Server 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
Access Services 2010 is a service application that allows users to modify and publish in SharePoint 2013 an Access web database that was previously created in SharePoint Server 2010. 
  
The Access client is not required to use the published web database. However, the Access client is required to make any changes to the database structure. 
 
> [!NOTE]
>  Access Services 2010 has been removed and is no longer supported by Microsoft in SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. We recommend exploring Microsoft [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) and [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/) as potential alternatives to Access Services 2010. 
    
## Set up SQL Server Reporting Services
<a name="section1"> </a>

You can update existing reports in an Access web database, but these reports require the installation and configuration of SQL Server Reporting Services Mode for SharePoint and the content database must be running SQL Server 2012. For more information, see [Install Reporting Services SharePoint Mode for SharePoint 2013](/sql/reporting-services/install-windows/install-the-first-report-server-in-sharepoint-mode?view=sql-server-2016) in SQL Server Books Online. 
  
## Start Access Database Service 2010

1. On the SharePoint Central Administration website, under **System Settings**, click **Manage services on the server**.
    
2. On the same row as the **Access Database Service 2010** service, under **Action**, click **Start**.

## Configure Access Services 2010 settings
<a name="section4"> </a>

There are no additional settings required after the initial installation of Access Services 2010. The services are ready to use as soon as the SharePoint 2013 installation is complete. However, you can change the default configuration settings to suit your business need. The following table contains the configurable Access Services settings.
  
1. Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a site administrator for the Access Services 2010 service application and also has Designer permissions.
    
2. In Central Administration, in the **Application Management** section, click **Manage service applications**.
    
3. Click the Access Services 2010 service application that you want to change.
    
4. On the Access Services 2010 settings page, change any of the settings shown in the following table.
