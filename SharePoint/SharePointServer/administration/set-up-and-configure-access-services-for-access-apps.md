# Set up and configure Access Services for Access apps in SharePoint Server 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)]
  
To install, set up, and provision Access apps for SharePoint in Access Services in SharePoint Server 2013, perform the following steps:
  
1. Install and configure SQL Server 2012 Enterprise software, because an Access app stores its data in a separate SQL Server back-end database.
    
2. Configure SharePoint 2013 for apps for SharePoint, because an Access app is an app for SharePoint.
    
3. Configure Access Services for Access apps so that Access Services can successfully run Access apps.
    
4. Create a dedicated SharePoint site collection for Access apps, because each Access app requires its own subsite.
    
For information about how to set up and configure Access Services for Access apps, see the following white paper:
