[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
This article provides links to common scenarios and the specific steps you need to take to integrate the cloud-based Viva Engage service with your SharePoint Server 2019, SharePoint Server 2016, or SharePoint Server 2013 environment. Depending on your current environment and the state of your Viva Engage deployment, the steps will vary.
  
We recommend that you reserve some time to complete all of the steps for the scenario that you choose to implement, and, if applicable, get the IT help you need. 
  
 [!NOTE]
> If your SharePoint Server is hosted in a cloud environment, such as Microsoft Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the guidance in these articles also applies.
