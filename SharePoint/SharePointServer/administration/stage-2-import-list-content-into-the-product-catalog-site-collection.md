## Start stage 2

After we've set up our Product Catalog Site Collection, as described in [Stage 1: Create site collections for cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server](stage-1-create-site-collections-for-cross-site-publishing.md), we can import content into this site collection. To do this, we'll use PowerShell scripts. But before we start, let's take a look at what is automatically created in a **Product Catalog Site Collection**. 
  
In our newly created **Product Catalog Site Collection**, we can see a default list template named **Products**. 
  
![Product List](../media/OTCSP_ProductsList.PNG)
  
The **Products** list contains a managed metadata site column named **Item Category**. 
  
![Item Category](../media/OTCSP_ItemCategory.PNG)
  
The **Item Category** site column is associated with the term set named **Product Hierarchy**. 
  
![Product Hierarchy](../media/OTCSP_ProductHierarchy.PNG)
  
To import list content into the **Products** list, we'll use PowerShell scripts that will: 
  
- Add content to the **Products** list. 
    
- Add terms to the **Product Hierarchy** term set. 
    
- Associate each item in the **Products** list with the correct term from the **Product Hierarchy** term set, and display this in the **Item Category** column in the **Products** list. 
    
Before we can run the PowerShell scripts, we'll have to prepare the following:
  
- A list of the site columns we want to add to the **Products** list. 
    
- A tab delimited text file that contains the content we want to add to the **Products** list. 
    
- A tab delimited text file that contains the taxonomy to be added to the **Product Hierarchy** term set. 
    
The PowerShell scripts, instructions on how to create the tab delimited text files, and instructions on how to change and use the import scripts can be found in [Import list content to Products list for SharePoint 2013](/samples/browse/?redirectedfrom=TechNet-Gallery).
  
After we have run the five PowerShell scripts, we get the following:
  
- List content in the **Products** list. In our scenario, each list item is a product that Contoso want to display on their website. 
    
- Terms in the **Product Hierarchy** term set. In our scenario, the term set reflects how Contoso has categorized their products, for example one category is called "Laptops" and another is "MP3" players. 
    
- In the **Products** list, content in the **Item Category** column is associated with the correct term from the **Product Hierarchy** term set. The following screen shot shows how the list item *Southridge Video Laptop15.4W M1548* is associated with the term *Laptops* through the **Item Category** column.

So, now that we have content in the **Products** list, the next task is to enable this list as a catalog.
