# Supported high availability and disaster recovery options for SharePoint databases

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
This article describes the supported high availability and disaster recovery options for SharePoint Server databases. For detailed information about these databases, such as size and supported backup and recovery tools, see [Database types and descriptions in SharePoint Server](../technical-reference/database-types-and-descriptions.md). 
  
    
## Introduction
<a name="Intro"> </a>

The scope of this article is the supported high availability and disaster recovery solutions for each SharePoint Server system and service application database. These solutions address the database level, instead of the database instance or database server level and include the following: database mirroring, database availability groups, and log shipping.
  
When you evaluate a high availability or a disaster recovery option for SharePoint, you must understand that not all of the options are supported by each SharePoint database. This is because of design requirements and feature characteristics.
  
This article identifies the supported option for each SharePoint database. These databases are grouped by SKU and then by feature.
  
## SharePoint Server system databases
<a name="SystemDBs"> </a>

The Configuration, Central Administration Content, and Content databases are the databases that are automatically installed when you deploy any SharePoint 2013 edition, and any SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Server 2019 server roles using the MinRole feature. For more information, see [Description of MinRole and associated services in SharePoint Servers 2016 and 2019](description-of-minrole-and-associated-services-in-sharepoint-server-2016.md).
  
The following tables provide the supported high availability and disaster recovery options for the SharePoint system databases.

## Supported Versions of SQL Server

For supported versions of SQL Server, see:
- [Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint Server 2019](../install/hardware-and-software-requirements-2019.md)
- [Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint Server 2016](../install/hardware-and-software-requirements.md)
- [Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint 2013](../install/hardware-software-requirements-2013.md)

## SQL Server System databases
<a name="SQLSysDbs"> </a>

SharePoint Server is built on SQL Server and uses the following SQL Server system databases: master, msdb, model, Resource, and tempdb. SQL Server provides a complete set of administrative tools that let users fully administer their system and manage all users and objects in a database. For more information about the SQL Server system databases, see [System Databases](/sql/relational-databases/databases/system-databases?viewFallbackFrom=sql-server-2014).
  
You can only mirror user databases, put them in a SQL Server Always On availability group or log ship them. You can't use these approaches to provide high availability or disaster recovery for the system databases.
  
## SQL Server Reporting Services databases
<a name="SQLRSDbs"> </a>

The following SQL Server Reporting Services databases can be used as part of a SharePoint Server deployment:
  
- Report Server Catalog (ReportingService_\<GUID\>) - Stores all report metadata including report definitions, report history and snapshots, and scheduling information. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > When Report Server Catalog is used, report documents are stored in SharePoint content databases. 
  
- ReportServerTempDB (ReportingService_\<GUID\>_TempDB) - Stores all the temporary snapshots while reports are running.
    
- Report Server Alerting (ReportingService_\<GUID\>_Alerting) - Stores all Data Alerts and runtime information.
    
A Reporting Services report server is a stateless server that stores application data, content, properties, and session information in two SQL Server relational databases. The best way to ensure the availability of Reporting Services functionality is to do the following:
  
- Use the high availability features of the SQL Server Database Engine to maximize the uptime of the report server databases. If you configure a Database Engine instance to run in a failover cluster, you can select that instance when you create a report server database.
    
- Use SQL Server Always On Availability Groups with the Reporting Services databases and for data sources where applicable.
    
- Configure multiple report servers to run in a scale-out deployment, where all the servers share a single report server database. Deploying multiple report server instances on different servers can help increase the level of uninterrupted service.
