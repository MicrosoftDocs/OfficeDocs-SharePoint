# View certificate default settings

SharePoint supports farm-wide default settings for certificate management. These include default properties for creating and renewing certificates and certificate health rule thresholds.

Use the [Get-SPCertificateSettings](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/get-spcertificatesettings) PowerShell cmdlet to view the certificate management default settings.
