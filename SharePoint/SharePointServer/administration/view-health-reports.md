[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md.md)] 
  
Health reports are pre-built reports in SharePoint Server that use usage data to analyze various aspects of sites and site collections such as slowest pages and top active users.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use Microsoft PowerShell to view health report data.

SharePoint Server supports the accessibility features of supported browsers.
