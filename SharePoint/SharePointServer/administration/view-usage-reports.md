# View usage reports in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
The Analytics Processing Component generates two reports that are based on usage event types:
  
- **Popularity Trends** shows usage event statistics for a site collection, a site, or an individual item in a library or list. 
    
- **Most Popular Items** shows usage event statistics for all items in a library or list. 
    
The reports are broken down per usage event type. The default usage event types are as follows: 
  
- **Views.** The number of views for a single item, page, or document. 
    
- **Recommendations Displayed.** The number of times a single item, page, or document was displayed as a recommendation. 
    
- **Recommendations Clicked.** The number of times a single item, page, or document was clicked when it was displayed as a recommendation. 
    
If you have added any custom usage event types, these types will also be displayed.
  
For more information about the Analytics Processing Component and usage events, see [Overview of analytics processing in SharePoint Server](../search/overview-of-analytics-processing.md). For information about search reports — for example, Number of Queries or Top Queries by Day — see "Usage reports" in [View search diagnostics in SharePoint Server](../search/view-search-diagnostics.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Usage reports are only available for Document Libraries and Product Catalog lists.

## View the Most Popular Items report
<a name="BKMK_MostPopular"> </a>

The Most Popular Items report lists the most popular items per usage event type for all items in a library or list —for example, the most viewed items in the library or list. The report can be sorted by the time periods **Recent** or **Ever**. By default, the Recent time period is set to the last 14 days, but you can change this setting to be any value from 1 to 14 days. For information about how to change the Recent time period, see "To change the Recent time period for a usage event" in [Configure recommendations and usage event types in SharePoint Server](configure-recommendations-and-usage-event-types.md). The Ever time period is from the first time that the item became available up to present day.
