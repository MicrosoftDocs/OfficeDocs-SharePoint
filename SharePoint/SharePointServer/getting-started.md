# Getting started with SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

## What is SharePoint?

SharePoint is a powerful collaboration platform that lets you share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to empower teamwork.
  
SharePoint Server can be used on-premises or with a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription to take advantage of all the latest features. Share common resources and applications on sites. Use search to discover information and expertise across your organization. And stay in the know with personalized news in SharePoint home and the SharePoint mobile apps.

## Where do I start?

If you are new to SharePoint Server, make a plan as to what you want to do and where you are going. If you have never deployed SharePoint, consider how large an installation you need. Do you have a large enterprise environment with hundreds or more licenses?  Or do you have smaller deployment in mind?  Your hardware requirements and budget may also be a factor in your deployment.

Depending on your version, system requirements and prerequisites could vary.
