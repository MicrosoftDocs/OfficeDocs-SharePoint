|**Step**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**1. [Configure Office 365 for SharePoint hybrid](configure-office-365-for-sharepoint-hybrid.md)** <br/> |Configure your Office 365 tenant for a hybrid environment, including registering your domain, configuring UPN suffixes, and synchronizing your user accounts.  <br/> |
