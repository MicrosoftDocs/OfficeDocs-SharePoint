>[!IMPORTANT]
>Hybrid Federated Search in SharePoint for Microsoft 365 (Inbound), the capability to display search results from SharePoint on-premises content in SharePoint Online, has been retired as of September 2024. Hybrid Federated Search for SharePoint Server (Outbound), the ability to view SharePoint Online search results in SharePoint on-premises, and Cloud hybrid search remain operational. If you need to display search results from external content in SharePoint Online, we recommend you use Microsoft Search Graph Connectors or Cloud hybrid search.
