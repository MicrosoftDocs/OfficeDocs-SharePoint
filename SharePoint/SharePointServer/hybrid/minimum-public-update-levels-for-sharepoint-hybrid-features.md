# Minimum public update levels for SharePoint hybrid features

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md.md)]

SharePoint Server offers a variety of hybrid scenarios to help connect you on-premises SharePoint environment to Microsoft 365. Since these features have been released over time, they may require a minimum Public Update (PU) in order to work. This article is a reference for which updates are required for each hybrid feature.
  
Keep in mind that these are minimum updates. Later PUs are fine, and we always recommend that you keep your farm updated with the latest Public Update.
  
Links to all the available Public Updates can be found at [SharePoint in Microsoft 365 Updates](/officeupdates/sharepoint-updates).
  
> [!NOTE]
> [Hybrid extranet B2B collaboration sites](/sharepoint/create-b2b-extranet) have no on-premises components and thus have no PU requirements.
