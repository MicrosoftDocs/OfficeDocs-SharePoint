# Removing SharePoint hybrid scenarios

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-SPO-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-SPO-md.md)]

This guide will walk you through removing SharePoint Hybrid functionality from your SharePoint in Microsoft 365 farm.

## Cloud Hybrid Search

Cloud Hybrid Search may be removed by deleting the Search Service Application.

1. In the **Central Administration** website, select **Application Management**.
2. In the **Application Management** page, select **Manage service applications**.
3. In the **Service Application** page, highlight your Cloud Hybrid Search Service Application. The name of the Service Application may vary, but the **Type** will be **Search Service Application**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Type** is identical to the standard SharePoint in Microsoft 365 Search Service Application.

4. On the ribbon, select **Delete**.
5. You may then create a new non-Cloud Search Service Application. For info about how to create and manage your Search Service Application, see the SharePoint Server documentation in [Search](../search/search.md).

## OneDrive and sites

After you have configured OneDrive and Sites hybrid, you can manage it in the SharePoint in Microsoft 365 Central Administration website.

1. In the **Central Administration** website, select **Microsoft 365**.
2. On the Microsoft 365 page, select **Configure hybrid OneDrive and Sites features**.
3. On the **Configure hybrid OneDrive and Sites features** page, under the **Select hybrid features**, select **None**, and then select **OK**.

Setting the option to **None** also removes the Hybrid app launcher feature.

## SharePoint hybrid taxonomy and hybrid content types

See [Stopping replication of taxonomy groups](./configure-hybrid-sharepoint-taxonomy-and-hybrid-content-types.md#stopping-replication-of-taxonomy-groups).

## Hybrid self-service site creation

See [Manage hybrid self-service site creation](./hybrid-self-service-site-creation.md#manage-hybrid-self-service-site-creation).

## Removing the Azure Access Control Service Application Proxy and SharePoint in Microsoft 365 Application Principal Management Service Application Proxy

The final step to removing hybrid is to delete the **Azure Access Control Service Application Proxy** and **SharePoint Application Principal Management Service Application Proxy** created by the hybrid picker.

1. In the **Central Administration** website, select **Application Management**.
2. In the **Application Management** page, select **Manage service applications**.
3. In the **Service Applications** page, highlight the Service Application named **ACS**. On the ribbon, select **Delete**.
4. In the **Service Applications** page, highlight the Service Application named **SharePoint App Management Proxy**. On the ribbon, select **Delete**.
5. Perform an iisreset on all SharePoint Servers in the farm.
