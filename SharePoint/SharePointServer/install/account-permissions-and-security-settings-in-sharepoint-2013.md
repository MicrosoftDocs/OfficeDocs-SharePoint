# Account permissions and security settings in SharePoint 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
This article describes SharePoint administrative and services account permissions for the following areas: Microsoft SQL Server, the file system, file shares, and registry entries.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use service account names that contain the symbol $ with the exception of using a Group Managed Service Account for SQL Server.
   
## About account permissions and security settings
<a name="Section1"> </a>

The SharePoint Configuration Wizard (psconfig) and the Farm Creation Wizard, both of which are run during a Complete installation, configure many of the SharePoint baseline account permissions and security settings.
  
## SharePoint administrative accounts
<a name="Section2"> </a>

One of the following SharePoint components automatically configures most of the SharePoint administrative account permissions during the setup process:
  
- The SharePoint Configuration Wizard (Psconfig).
    
- The Farm Creation Wizard.
    
- The SharePoint Central Administration web site.
    
- PowerShell.
    
### Farm administrator user  account

This account is a uniquely identifiable account assigned to the SharePoint admin and is used to set up each server in your farm by running the SharePoint Configuration Wizard, the initial Farm Creation Wizard, and PowerShell. The account must be a domain user. For the examples in this article, the farm administrator account is used for farm administration, and you can use Central Administration to manage it. Some configuration options such as configuration of the SharePoint 2013 Search query server require local administration permissions. The farm administrator user account requires the following permissions:
  
- It must be a member of the Local Administrators group on each server in the SharePoint farm.
    
- This account must have access to the SharePoint databases.
    
- If you use any PowerShell operations that affect a database, the setup user administrator account must be a member of the **db_owner** role or **sysadmin** fixed server role.
    
- This account must be assigned to the **securityadmin** and **dbcreator** fixed server roles during setup and configuration or the **sysadmin** fixed server role in SQL Server.
    
> [!NOTE]
> The **securityadmin** and **dbcreator** SQL Server security roles might be required for this account during a complete version-to-version upgrade because new databases might have to be created and secured for services. 
  
After you run the configuration wizards, machine-level permissions for the setup user administrator account include:
  
- Membership in the WSS_ADMIN_WPG Windows security group.
    
- Membership in the WSS_WPG role.
    
After you run the configuration wizards, database permissions include:
  
- **db_owner** on the SharePoint server farm configuration database. 
    
- **db_owner** on the SharePoint Central Administration content database. 
    
> [!CAUTION]
> If the account that you use to run the configuration wizards does not have the appropriate special SQL Server role membership or access as **db_owner** on the databases, the configuration wizards will not run correctly. 
  
### SharePoint farm service account

The server farm account, which is also referred to as the database access account, is used as the application pool identity for Central Administration and as the process account for the SharePoint Foundation 2013 Timer service. The server farm account must be a domain user account.

Permissions are automatically granted to the server farm account on web servers and application servers that are joined to a server farm.
    
After you run the configuration wizards, SQL Server and database permissions include:
      
- Membership in the WSS_ADMIN_WPG Windows security group for the SharePoint Foundation 2013 Timer service.
    
- Membership in WSS_RESTRICTED_WPG for the Central Administration and Timer service application pools.
    
- Membership in WSS_WPG for the Central Administration application pool.

- **Dbcreator** fixed server role. 
    
- **Securityadmin** fixed server role. 
    
- **db_owner** for all SharePoint databases. 
    
- Membership in the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role for the SharePoint server farm configuration database.
    
- Membership in the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role for the SharePoint_Admin content database.
    
## SharePoint service application accounts
<a name="Section3"> </a>

This section describes the service application accounts that are set up by default during installation.
  
### Application pool account

The application pool account is used for application pool identity. The application pool account must be a domain user account.
  
The following machine-level permission is configured automatically: 

- The application pool account is a member of WSS_WPG.
  
The following SQL Server and database permissions for this account are configured automatically:
  
- The application pool accounts for Web applications are assigned to the SP_DATA_ACCESS role for the content databases.
    
- This account is assigned to the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role associated with the farm configuration database.
    
- This account is assigned to the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role associated with the SharePoint_Admin content database.
    
### Default content access account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information in this section applies to SharePoint Server 2016 only. 
  
The default content access account is used within a specific service application to crawl content, unless a different authentication method is specified by a crawl rule for a URL or URL pattern. This account requires the following permission configuration settings:
  
- The default content access account must be a domain user account that has read access to external or secure content sources that you want to crawl by using this account.
    
- For SharePoint Server sites that are not part of the server farm, you have to explicitly grant this account full read permissions to the web applications that host the sites.
    
- This account must not be a member of the Farm Administrators group.
    
### Content access accounts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information in this section applies to SharePoint Server 2016 only. 
  
Content access accounts are configured to access content by using the Search administration crawl rules feature. This type of account is optional and you can configure it when you create a new crawl rule. For example, external content (such as a file share) might require this separate content access account. This account requires the following permission configuration settings:
  
- The content access account must have read access to external or secure content sources that this account is configured to access.

- The content access account must hold the **Manage auditing and security log** right in the Local User Policy on Windows file servers it is configured to crawl.
    
- For SharePoint Server sites that are not part of the server farm, you have to explicitly grant this account full read permissions to the web applications that host the sites. 
    
### Excel Services unattended service account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information in this section applies to SharePoint Server 2016 only. 
  
Excel Services uses the Excel Services unattended service account to connect to external data sources that require a user name and password that are based on operating systems other than Windows for authentication. If this account is not configured, Excel Services will not attempt to connect to these types of data sources. Although account credentials are used to connect to data sources of operating systems other than Windows, if the account is not a member of the domain, Excel Services cannot access them. This account must be a domain user account.
  
### My Sites application pool account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information in this section applies to SharePoint Server 2016 only. 
  
The My Sites application pool account must be a domain user account. This account must not be a member of the Farm Administrators group. 
  
The following machine-level permission is configured automatically: 

- This account is a member of WSS_WPG.
  
The following SQL Server and database permissions are configured automatically:
  
- This account is assigned to the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role that is associated with the farm configuration database.
    
- This account is assigned to the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role that is associated with the SharePoint_Admin content database.
    
- The application pool accounts for web applications are assigned to the SP_DATA_ACCESS role for the content databases
    
### Other application pool accounts

The other application pool account must be a domain user account. This account must not be a member of the Administrators group on any computer in the server farm.
  
The following machine-level permission is configured automatically: 

- This account is a member of WSS_WPG.
  
The following SQL Server and database permissions are configured automatically:
  
- This account is assigned to the SP_DATA_ACCESS role for the content databases.
    
- This account is assigned to the SP_DATA_ACCESS role for search database that is associated with the web application.
    
- This account must have read and write access to the associated service application database.
    
- This account is assigned to the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role that is associated with the farm configuration database.
    
- This account is assigned to the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role that is associated with the SharePoint_Admin content database.

> [!NOTE]
> We strongly recommend you use a single Web Application Pool account for all Web Applications in the farm, including the My Sites Web Application. The exception is the Central Administration Web Application which uses the Farm service account.

## SharePoint database roles
<a name="Section4"> </a>

This section describes the database roles that installation sets up by default or that you can configure optionally.
  
### WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS database role

The WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS database role applies to the application pool account for each web application that is registered in a SharePoint farm. This enables web applications to query and update the site map and have read-only access to other items in the configuration database. Setup assigns the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role to the following databases:
  
- The SharePoint_Config database (the configuration database).
    
- The SharePoint_Admin content database.
    
Members of the WSS_CONTENT_APPLICATION_POOLS role have the execute permission for a subset of the stored procedures for the database. In addition, members of this role have the select permission to the Versions table (dbo.Versions) in the SharePoint_Admin content database. For other databases, the accounts planning tool indicates that access to read these databases is automatically configured. In some cases, limited access to write to a database is also automatically configured. To provide this access, permissions for stored procedures are configured. 
  
#### WSS_SHELL_ACCESS database role

The secure WSS_SHELL_ACCESS database role on the configuration database replaces the need to add an administration account as a **db_owner** on the configuration database. By default, the farm administrator account which initially ran the Configuration Wizard is assigned to the WSS_SHELL_ACCESS database role. You can use a PowerShell command to grant or remove memberships to this role. Setup assigns the WSS_SHELL_ACCESS role to the following databases: 
  
- The SharePoint_Config database (the configuration database).
    
- One or more of the SharePoint Content databases. This is configurable by using the PowerShell command that manages membership and the object that is assigned to this role.
    
Members of the WSS_SHELL_ACCESS role have the execute permission for all stored procedures for the database. In addition, members of this role have the read and write permissions on all of the database tables.
  
#### SP_READ_ONLY database role

The **SP_READ_ONLY** role should be used for setting the database to read only mode instead of using sp_dboption. This role as its name suggests should be used when only read access is required for data such as usage and telemetry data. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The sp_dboption stored procedure is not available in SQL Server 2012. For more information about sp_dboption see [sp_dboption (Transact-SQL)](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms187310(v=sql.105)). 
  
The SP_READ_ONLY SQL role will have the following permissions:
  
- Grant SELECT on all SharePoint stored procedures and functions
    
- Grant SELECT on all SharePoint tables
    
- Grant EXECUTE on user-defined type where schema is dbo
    
#### SP_DATA_ACCESS database role

The **SP_DATA_ACCESS** role is the default role for database access and should be used for all object model level access to databases. Add the application pool account to this role during upgrade or new deployments. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The SP_DATA_ACCESS role replaces the db_owner role in SharePoint 2013. 
  
The SP_DATA_ACCESS role will have the following permissions:
  
- Grant EXECUTE or SELECT on all SharePoint stored procedures and functions
    
- Grant SELECT on all SharePoint tables
    
- Grant EXECUTE on User-defined type where schema is dbo
    
- Grant INSERT on AllUserDataJunctions table
    
- Grant UPDATE on Sites view
    
- Grant UPDATE on UserData view
    
- Grant UPDATE on AllUserData table
    
- Grant INSERT and DELETE on NameValuePair tables
    
- Grant create table permission
    
## Group permissions
<a name="Section5"> </a>

This section describes permissions of groups that the SharePoint 2013 setup and configuration tools create.
