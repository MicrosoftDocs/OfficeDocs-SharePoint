# Plan browser support in SharePoint 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)]. 
  
SharePoint 2013 supports several commonly used web browsers, such as ![Internet Explorer browser logo](../media/internetexplorersmall.png) Internet Explorer, ![Google Chrome browser logo](../media/chrome-small.jpg) Google Chrome, ![Mozilla Firefox browser logo](../media/firefox_small.png) Mozilla Firefox, ![Apple Safari browser logo](../media/safari-small.png) Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. However, certain web browsers could cause some SharePoint 2013 functionality to be downgraded, limited, or available only through alternative steps. 
  
As you plan your deployment of SharePoint 2013, we recommend that you review the browsers used in your organization to guarantee optimal performance with SharePoint 2013.
  
    
## Key planning phase of browser support
<a name="section2"> </a>

Browser support is an important part of your SharePoint 2013 implementation. Before you install SharePoint 2013, make sure that you know the browsers that SharePoint 2013 supports. The information in this article describes browser support in the following sections:
  
- Browser support matrix
    
- Browser details
    
### Browser support matrix

### Browser details
<a name="browserdetail"> </a>

Review the details of the web browser that you have or plan to use in your organization to make sure that the web browser works with SharePoint 2013 and according to your business needs.
  
#### Supported Internet Explorer versions

The product group makes every effort to validate that SharePoint functionality works correctly with released versions of Internet Explorer. Customers who want a more deeply validated browser interaction experience should strongly consider Internet Explorer.
  
 **Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Internet Explorer 10, Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 8**
  
> [!NOTE]
> Internet Explorer 11  *edge mode*  is not supported. Add sites to the **Compatibility View** list to make some features work. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based and EdgeHTML-based) is supported with the SharePoint Server 2013 December 2015 CU. For additional information about the December 2015 CU, see [December 8, 2015, update for SharePoint Foundation 2013 (KB3114352)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3114352)
  
#### Other supported browsers

- **Google Chrome (latest released version)**
    
- **Mozilla Firefox (latest released version plus immediate previous version)**
    
    For example, if the latest released version is 10, then version 9 would be supported.
    
- **Apple Safari (latest released version)**
    
#### ActiveX controls
<a name="activex"> </a>

Some functionality in SharePoint 2013 requires ActiveX controls. This produces limitations on browsers which do not support ActiveX. Currently only 32-bit versions of Internet Explorer support this functionality. All other browsers have the following limitations.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Internet Explorer 10 does not support Active X controls when in immersive mode. The functionality for the controls listed below should only be expected to work in desktop mode.
