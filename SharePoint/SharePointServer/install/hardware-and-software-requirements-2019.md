# Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint Server 2019

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-2019-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-2019-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you contact Microsoft Customer Support Services about a production system that does not meet the minimum hardware specifications described in this article, support will be limited until the system is upgraded to the minimum requirements. 
  
    
## Hardware requirements: Location of physical servers
<a name="hwLocServers"> </a>

Some enterprises have datacenters that are in close proximity to one another and connected by high-bandwidth fiber optic links. In this environment, you can configure the two datacenters as a single farm. This distributed farm topology is called a stretched farm. Stretched farms are supported for SharePoint Server 2019.
  
For a stretched farm architecture to work as a supported high-availability solution, the following prerequisites must be met:
  
- There is a highly consistent intra-farm latency of \<1 ms one way, 99.9% of the time over a period of ten minutes. (Intra-farm latency is commonly defined as the latency between the front-end web servers and the database servers.)
    
- The bandwidth speed must be at least 1 gigabit per second.
    
To provide fault tolerance in a stretched farm, use the standard best practice guidance to configure redundant service applications and databases.
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The intra-farm latency of \<1 ms one way, 99.9% of the time over a period of ten minutes is also required for SharePoint environments with servers that are located in the same datacenter. The bandwidth speed should also be in this case at least 1 gigabit per second.
  
## Hardware requirements: SharePoint Servers and MinRole installations
<a name="hwforwebserver"> </a>

The values in the following table are minimum values for installations on servers that are running SharePoint Server 2019 in a multiple server farm installation.
  
For all installation scenarios, you must have sufficient hard disk space for the base installation and sufficient space for diagnostics such as logging, debugging, creating memory dumps, and so on. For production use, you must also have additional free disk space for day-to-day operations. In addition, maintain two times as much free space as you have RAM for production environments.
  
For information about hardware and software requirements for Microsoft SQL Server 2016 or higher, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server](/sql/sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server).
