# Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)]
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you contact Microsoft Customer Support Services about a production system that does not meet the minimum hardware specifications described in this document, support will be limited until the system is upgraded to the minimum requirements. 
  
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the hardware requirement values in this article are based on test results from SharePoint 2010 Products and still apply to SharePoint 2013. This article will be updated with appropriate values and republished when new data becomes available. Hardware requirement values obtained from SharePoint 2010 Products that are listed in this article do not apply to search in SharePoint 2013. > This article links to SharePoint 2010 Products guidance where that guidance is still valid. The SharePoint 2010 Products guidance is not applicable for search in SharePoint 2013 because the search architecture has changed significantly. > The hardware and software requirements in this article refer to physical and virtual servers in a SharePoint farm. 
  
## Overview
<a name="section1"> </a>

SharePoint 2013 provides for several installation scenarios. Currently, these installations include single server with built-in database installations, single-server farm installations, and multiple-server farm installations. This article describes the hardware and software requirements for SharePoint 2013 in each of these scenarios.
  
## Hardware and software requirements for other SharePoint 2013 capabilities
<a name="reqOtherCap"> </a>

If you plan to use capabilities that are offered through SharePoint 2013 or through other integration channels, such as SQL Server or Exchange Server, you also need to meet the hardware and software requirements that are specific to that capability. The following list provides links to hardware and software requirements for some SharePoint 2013 capabilities:
  
- [Hardware and software requirements (Project Server 2013)](/project/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-project-server-2013)
    
- For eDiscovery, each front-end web server must have the Exchange Web Services Managed API, version 1.2 installed. For more information, see the following articles:
    
  - [Configure eDiscovery in SharePoint Server](../governance/configure-ediscovery-2019.md)
    
  - [Configure Exchange for SharePoint eDiscovery Center](/exchange/configure-exchange-for-sharepoint-ediscovery-center-exchange-2013-help)
    
    
- Hardware requirements for search in SharePoint Server 2013:
    
  - [Step 3: Which hardware requirements should I be aware of?](../search/plan-enterprise-search-architecture.md#BKMK_AssignHW)
    
  - [Hardware requirements for search topologies for Internet sites](../search/scale-search-for-internet-sites.md#HW_FIS)
    
- [Mobile device browsers supported in SharePoint 2013](../administration/supported-mobile-device-browsers.md)
    
## Hardware requirements—location of physical servers
<a name="hwLocServers"> </a>

Some enterprises have data centers that are located in close proximity to one another and are connected by high-bandwidth fiber optic links. In this environment it is possible to configure the two data centers as a single farm. This distributed farm topology is called a stretched farm. Stretched farms for SharePoint 2013 are supported as of April 2013. 
  
For a stretched farm architecture to work as a supported high-availability solution, the following prerequisites must be met:
  
- There is a highly consistent intra-farm latency of \<1ms one way, 99.9% of the time over a period of ten minutes. (Intra-farm latency is commonly defined as the latency between the front-end web servers and the database servers.)
    
- The bandwidth speed must be at least 1 gigabit per second. 
    
To provide fault tolerance in a stretched farm, use the standard best practice guidance to configure redundant service applications and databases. For more information, see [Create a high availability architecture and strategy for SharePoint Server](../administration/plan-for-high-availability.md).
  
## Hardware requirements—web servers, application servers, and single server installations
<a name="hwforwebserver"> </a>

The values in the following table are minimum values for installations on a single server with a built-in database and for web and application servers that are running SharePoint 2013 in a multiple server farm installation. 
  
For all installation scenarios, you must have sufficient hard disk space for the base installation and sufficient space for diagnostics such as logging, debugging, creating memory dumps, and so on. For production use, you must also have additional free disk space for day-to-day operations. In addition, maintain two times as much free space as you have RAM for production environments. For more information, see [Capacity management and sizing for SharePoint Server 2013](../administration/capacity-management-and-sizing-for-sharepoint-server-2013.md).
  
|**Installation Scenario**|**Deployment type and scale**|**RAM**|**Processor**|**Hard disk space**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Single server with a built-in database or single server that uses SQL Server  <br/> |Development or evaluation installation of SharePoint Server 2013 or SharePoint Foundation 2013 with the minimum recommended services for development environments. For information, see [Minimum recommended services for development environments](hardware-and-software-requirements.md).  <br/> |8 GB  <br/> |64-bit, 4 cores  <br/> |80 GB for system drive  <br/> |
|Single server with a built-in database or single server that uses SQL Server  <br/> |Development or evaluation installation of SharePoint Server 2013 or SharePoint Foundation 2013 running Visual Studio 2012 and the minimum recommended services for development environments. For information, see [Minimum recommended services for development environments](hardware-and-software-requirements.md).  <br/> |10 GB  <br/> |64-bit, 4 cores  <br/> |80 GB for system drive  <br/> |
|Single server with a built-in database or single server that uses SQL Server  <br/> |Development or evaluation installation of SharePoint Server 2013 running all available services.  <br/> |24 GB  <br/> |64-bit, 4 cores  <br/> |80 GB for system drive  <br/> |
|Web server or application server in a three-tier farm  <br/> |Pilot, user acceptance test, or production deployment of SharePoint Server 2013 or SharePoint Foundation 2013.  <br/> |12 GB  <br/> |64-bit, 4 cores  <br/> |80 GB for system drive  <br/> |
   
## Hardware requirements—database servers
<a name="section3"> </a>

The requirements in the following table apply to database servers in environments that have multiple servers in the farm. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The requirements listed in this section also apply to SQL Server 2014. 
  
|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> | 64-bit, 4 cores for small deployments (fewer than 1,000 users)  <br/>  64-bit, 8 cores for medium deployments (between 1,000 to 10,000 users)  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> | 8 GB for small deployments (fewer than 1,000 users)  <br/>  16 GB for medium deployments (between 1,000 to 10,000 users)  <br/>  For large deployments over 10,000 users, see the "Estimate memory requirements" section in [Storage and SQL Server capacity planning and configuration (SharePoint Server 2010)](../administration/storage-and-sql-server-capacity-planning-and-configuration.md). This document does not apply to search in SharePoint 2013.  <br/>  These values are larger than those recommended as the minimum values for SQL Server because of the distribution of data that is required for a SharePoint 2013 environment. For more information about SQL Server system requirements, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2008 R2](/sql/sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server).  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |80 GB for system drive  <br/> Hard disk space depends on how much content that you have in your deployment. For information about how to estimate the amount of content and other databases for your deployment, see [Storage and SQL Server capacity planning and configuration (SharePoint Server 2010)](../administration/storage-and-sql-server-capacity-planning-and-configuration.md).  <br/> |
   
## Software requirements
<a name="section4"> </a>

The requirements in the following section apply to the following installations: 
  
- Single server with built-in database
    
- Server farm with a single server in the farm
    
- Server farm with multiple servers in the farm

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SharePoint 2013 requires a minimum Active Directory domain and forest functional level of Windows Server 2003 (native). For more information about Active Directory functional levels, see [Forest and Domain Functional Levels](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/active-directory-functional-levels).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SharePoint 2013 does not support single label domain names. For more information, see [Information about configuring Windows for domains with single-label DNS names](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/deployment-operation-ad-domains). 
  
The Microsoft SharePoint Products Preparation Tool can assist you in the installation of the software prerequisites for SharePoint 2013. Ensure that you have an Internet connection, because some prerequisites are installed from the Internet. For more information about how to use the Microsoft SharePoint Products Preparation Tool, see [Install SharePoint 2013 across multiple servers for a three-tier farm](multiple-servers-for-a-three-tier-farm.md) and [Install SharePoint 2013 across multiple servers for a three-tier farm](multiple-servers-for-a-three-tier-farm.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server 2014 requires the May 2014 Cumulative Update to be installed. To install the May 2014 Cumulative Update see [Updates to SharePoint 2013](/officeupdates/).
