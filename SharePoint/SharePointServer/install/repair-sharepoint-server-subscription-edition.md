<a name="section1"> </a>

SharePoint Server repair steps are as follows:

## Repair on Windows Server with Desktop Experience

1. Click **Start**.

2. Click **Settings**.

3. Click **Apps**.

4. Click **Microsoft SharePoint Subscription Edition Preview**.

5. Click **Modify**.

6. If prompted by the User Account Control (UAC) consent dialog, click **Yes** to allow the Microsoft Setup Bootstrapper app to make changes to your device.

7. In the Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition Preview setup application, select **Repair** and then click **Continue**.

8. After setup finishes repairing SharePoint, click **Close** to exit.

9. If prompted to reboot your computer, click **Yes** to reboot.

10. After the computer reboots, launch the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard.

11. Click **Next**.

12. If prompted to automatically start or reset services, click **Yes**.

13. In the Modify server farm Settings page, select **Do not disconnect from this server farm** and then click **Next**.

14. If prompted whether to modify the SharePoint Central Administration web application settings, select **No, this machine will continue to host the web site** and then, click **Next**.

15. Click **Next** to begin the repair operation.

16. After the repair operation has finished, click **Finish**.

## Repair on Windows Server Core

1. Run SharePoint setup (`setup.exe`) from your **C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\SERVER16\Server Setup Controller** directory with the following parameters:

    - `/config <config file>` (Where `<config file>` is the path to your writable `config.xml` file)

    - `/repair OSERVER`

    ```powershell
    "$env:CommonProgramFiles\Microsoft Shared\SERVER16\Server Setup Controller\setup.exe" /config "C:\SharePoint Files\config.xml" /repair OSERVER  
    ```

2. Once SharePoint setup has completed, reboot your test server.

3. Run the following SharePoint PowerShell cmdlets with their appropriate parameters to repair the server in the farm.

    1. `Update-SPFlightsConfigFile -FilePath "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\16\CONFIG\SPFlightRawConfig.json"`
    2. `Install-SPHelpCollection -All`
    3. `Initialize-SPResourceSecurity`
    4. `Install-SPService`
    5. `Install-SPFeature -AllExistingFeatures`
    6. `New-SPCentralAdministration` (If hosting the Central Administration site on this server)
    7. `Install-SPApplicationContent`

    > [!Note]
    > You can also use the `PSCONFIG.EXE` command line tool or the `PSConfigUI.exe` GUI tool. However, `PSConfigUI.exe` will crash on Windows Server Core if it needs to display a summary of error messages at the end of the sequence due to a dependency on HTML rendering components.
