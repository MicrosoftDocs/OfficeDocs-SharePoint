# Software requirements for Database Servers for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 

## Operating systems

SharePoint Server Subscription Edition supports database servers deployed on the following operating systems:
- [Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019) Standard or Datacenter
- [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022) Standard or Datacenter

SharePoint Server Subscription Edition supports database servers deployed with the following Windows Server installation options:
- Server with Desktop Experience
- Server Core

## Database versions

SharePoint Server Subscription Edition supports the following database versions:

- A Standard or Enterprise Edition of SQL Server for Windows that supports database compatibility level 150. This includes SQL Server 2019 Cumulative Update 5 (CU5) or later, SQL Server 2022, and any future version of SQL Server for Windows that supports database compatibility level 150. For more information about database compatibility levels, see [Compatibility Certification](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/compatibility-certification) and [ALTER DATABASE (Transact-SQL) Compatibility Level](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level).

- Microsoft Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI). This is only supported if your SharePoint Server farm is hosted in Microsoft Azure. For more information, see [Deploy SharePoint Server with Azure SQL Managed Instance](/sharepoint/administration/deploy-azure-sql-managed-instance-with-sharepoint-servers).

> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server products and all future SQL Server Cumulative Updates are supported through the SQL Server product lifecycle.

> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server Express is not supported. Azure SQL Database (the non-Managed Instance DBaaS service) is also not supported for any SharePoint databases.
