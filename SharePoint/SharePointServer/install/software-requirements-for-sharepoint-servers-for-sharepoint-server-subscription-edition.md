# Software requirements for SharePoint Servers for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 

## Operating systems

SharePoint Server supports the following operating systems:

- [Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019) Standard or Datacenter
- [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022) Standard or Datacenter

SharePoint Server Subscription Edition supports the following Windows Server installation options:

- Server with Desktop Experience
- Server Core

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft does not support installing Microsoft Office and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition on the same computer.

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum Microsoft Office version supported with SharePoint Server Subscription Edition is Microsoft Office 2013.

## Prerequisites 

SharePoint Server Subscription Edition requires additional software prerequisites. Those prerequisites can be installed through the `prerequisiteinstaller.exe` tool on the SharePoint Server Subscription Edition installation disc, or manually as described below.

### Software prerequisites

The SharePoint Server Subscription Edition prerequisite installer (`prerequisiteinstaller.exe`) installs the following software if they haven't already been installed on the target server. The software is installed in the following order:

1. Web Server (IIS) Role

2. [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085155)

3. [Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2015-2019](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2130438)

### Prerequisite installer operation and command-line options

You can run `prerequisiteinstaller.exe` with no parameters or at a command prompt with the following optional parameters. When you run `prerequisiteinstaller.exe`, you might be asked to restart the server one or more times during the software installation process. If you're running it at a command prompt, you should continue the prerequisite installation by running `prerequisiteinstaller.exe` with the **/continue** parameter after restarting.

- **/?** This displays command-line options.

- **/continue** This is used to tell the installer that it is continuing from a restart.

- **/unattended** This indicates the installer should run with no user interaction. This is typically used when scripting the installation.

The prerequisite installer installs software from the file that you specify in the command-line options described in the following list. In this list, **\<_file_\>** signifies the file from which you want to install and **\<_path_\>** signifies the directory from which you want to install. If you do not specify the **\<_file_\>** or **\<_path_\>** options, the installer downloads the file from the Internet and installs it. If the option does not apply to the current operating system, it is ignored.

- **/WindowsSource:<_path_>** Install any "Features on Demand (FOD)" Windows features from <_path_> instead of downloading them from Windows Update. Use this parameter if the computer doesn't have access to Windows Update. The <_path_> is typically the **\sources\sxs** folder on the Windows Server installation media.

- **/DotNet48:<_file_>** Install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 from <_file_>.

- **/MSVCRT142:<_file_>** Install Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2015-2019 from <_file_>.

The prerequisite installer creates log files at **%TEMP%\prerequisiteinstaller.\<date>.\<time>.log**. You can check these log files for specific details about all changes the installer makes to the target computer.

### Manually configure Windows Server Roles and Features

To manually configure the required Windows Server Roles and Features, you can use one of two methods:

1. Server Manager

2. Microsoft PowerShell

To configure by using Server Manager, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](/windows-server/administration/server-manager/install-or-uninstall-roles-role-services-or-features).

To configure by using PowerShell, from a PowerShell command prompt window, type:

```PowerShell
Install-WindowsFeature NET-WCF-Pipe-Activation45,NET-WCF-HTTP-Activation45,NET-WCF-TCP-Activation45,Web-Server,Web-WebServer,Web-Common-Http,Web-Static-Content,Web-Default-Doc,Web-Dir-Browsing,Web-Http-Errors,Web-App-Dev,Web-Asp-Net45,Web-Net-Ext45,Web-ISAPI-Ext,Web-ISAPI-Filter,Web-Health,Web-Http-Logging,Web-Log-Libraries,Web-Request-Monitor,Web-Http-Tracing,Web-Security,Web-Basic-Auth,Web-Windows-Auth,Web-Filtering,Web-Performance,Web-Stat-Compression,Web-Dyn-Compression,WAS,WAS-Process-Model,WAS-Config-APIs -IncludeManagementTools
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some Windows features may be "Features on Demand (FOD)", which are downloaded from Windows Update.  If the computer doesn't have access to Windows Update, you can specify local installation files by adding the **Source** parameter to the `Install-WindowsFeature` PowerShell command and pointing to the **\sources\sxs** folder on the Windows Server installation media.
>
> For example: -Source D:\sources\sxs
