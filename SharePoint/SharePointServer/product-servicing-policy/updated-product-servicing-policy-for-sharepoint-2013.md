# Updated Product Servicing Policy for SharePoint 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
During mainstream support, Microsoft releases new Public Update (PU) builds for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 each month that contain the latest functionality, performance, and stability improvements for the product. To ensure that customers have a high-quality experience, Microsoft is adopting the following product servicing policy for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013.
  
## Policy overview

SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 Service Pack 1 will remain the minimum supported build through the end of mainstream support on 4/10/2018. Starting with extended support on 4/11/2018, Microsoft will update the minimum supported build of SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013. Customers must be running that build or higher to remain supported. If a customer contacts Microsoft support and their farm is not running the minimum supported build or higher, they will be asked to upgrade to that build before support can be offered.
  
The product servicing policy timeline for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 is described in the table below:
  
|**SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 Releases**|**Support End Date**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Service Pack 1  <br/> |4/10/2018  <br/> |

## Frequently Asked Question

 **Question**: Why is Microsoft doing this? 
  
 **Answer**: Previously, servicing for SharePoint was tied to specific types of releases - the initial RTM release and service packs. However, Microsoft has no plans to release new service packs for SharePoint and will instead only update SharePoint by way of monthly Public Updates. This new servicing policy ensures that customers are running a build that contains fixes for the most common issues that customers have been reporting to us, even if there are no additional service packs released. 
  
 **Question**: Where can I find the Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013? 
  
 **Answer**: The current list of Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 can be found in our [SharePoint Updates](/officeupdates/sharepoint-updates) article.
