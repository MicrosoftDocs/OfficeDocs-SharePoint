[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-2016-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-2016-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)]

During mainstream support, Microsoft releases new Public Update (PU) builds for SharePoint Server 2016 each month which contain the latest functionality, performance, and stability improvements for the product.

## Policy overview

To ensure that customers have a high-quality experience, Microsoft is adopting the following product servicing policy for SharePoint Server 2016:

- All SharePoint Server 2016 builds will be supported for at least one year from its release date.
- Microsoft will update the minimum supported build of SharePoint Server 2016 on each anniversary of General Availability (GA).
- You must be running SharePoint Server 2016's minimum supported build or its higher version to remain supported.
- If you contact the Microsoft support team and your farm isn't running the minimum supported build or its higher version, you might be required to upgrade to that build before the Microsoft Support team can offer any further assistance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

 **Question**: **Why is Microsoft doing this?**

 **Answer**: Previously, servicing for SharePoint was tied to specific types of releases - the initial RTM release and service packs. However, Microsoft has no plans to release new service packs for SharePoint and will instead only update SharePoint by way of monthly Public Updates. This new servicing policy ensures that customers are running a build that contains fixes for the most common issues that customers have been reporting to us, even if no further service packs are released.

 **Question**: **Will Microsoft release service packs for SharePoint Server 2016?**

 **Answer**: No, Microsoft has no plans to release service packs for SharePoint Server 2016. Functionality, performance, and stability improvements for SharePoint Server 2016 will be delivered by way of our monthly Public Updates.

 **Question**: **Where can I find the Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2016?**

 **Answer**: The current list of Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2016 can be found in our [SharePoint Updates](/officeupdates/sharepoint-updates) article.

 **Question**: **Do the monthly Public Updates contain all of the fixes included in the previous Public Updates?**

 **Answer**: Yes, the monthly Public Updates are cumulative. Each Public Update contains all of the fixes provided in the previous Public Updates.

 **Question**: **Do I need to install an earlier Public Update before I can install the latest Public Update?**

 **Answer**: No, you don't need to install an earlier Public Update before you install the latest Public Update. You can install any Public Update directly on an RTM installation.

 **Question**: **Should I install the monthly Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2016 immediately or should I install them only if they contain a fix for a specific issue I'm having?**

 **Answer**: Microsoft recommends that all customers install Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2016 as soon as they become available. Microsoft performs rigorous validation of each Public Update, both internally and with a select set of partners and customers before it's released to ensure it has the highest quality.
