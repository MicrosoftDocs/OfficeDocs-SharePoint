# Updated Product Servicing Policy for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

While in support, Microsoft releases new Public Update (PU) builds for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition each month which contain the latest functionality, performance, and stability improvements for the product.

## Policy overview

To ensure that customers have a high-quality experience, Microsoft is adopting the following product servicing policy for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition:

- The RTM build and all PUs for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition released before January 10, 2023 will be supported until December 12, 2023. 
- Starting January 10, 2023 PU for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition, each PU build will be supported for one year from its release date. 
- Support for a PU build ends on the second Tuesday of the same month of its release in the following year.
- To remain supported, you must be running the supported build of the SharePoint Server SE.
- If you contact Microsoft Support and your SharePoint Server farm isn't running the Subscription Edition's minimum supported build or its higher version, you might be required to upgrade to the supported build before Microsoft Support team can offer any further assistance.
