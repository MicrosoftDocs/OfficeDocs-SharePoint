The procedures in this article must be repeated on all the servers in the SharePoint Server farm that host a crawl component.
  
## Prerequisites
<a name="LN_Prereqs"> </a>

The following sections list the required administrative roles, software and user accounts. 
  
### Required administrative roles
<a name="LN_AdminRoles"> </a>

The following administrative roles are required to prepare any server that hosts a crawl component to crawl Lotus Notes content that is hosted by one or more Lotus Domino databases: 
  
- Administrator of the Lotus Domino server that you want to crawl.
    
- Server administrator of the server that hosts a crawl component that you want to use to crawl Lotus Notes content.
    
- Service application administrator for the Search service application.
    
### Required software
<a name="LN_SWReq"> </a>

The following software is required:
  
- Lotus C++ API Toolkit for Notes.
    
- Lotus Notes client application, available for purchase from IBM.
    
- Lotus Notes Domino Server, available for purchase from IBM.
    
The following table shows combinations of versions of the Lotus Notes Domino server and Lotus Notes client that the Lotus Notes Connector works with.
  
| This server version | With client 6.x | With client 7.x | With client 8.x |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |

### User accounts required to crawl Lotus Domino databases
<a name="LN_UserAcc"> </a>

A Domino administrator must grant a Lotus Notes user ID (which represents a Domino user) at least the Reader permission to the Lotus Domino databases and individual documents that you want to crawl. The Domino administrator must also add this Lotus Notes user ID and the Windows domain user account that is assigned to the SharePoint Server Search 15 service (OSearch15) to a mappings database on the Lotus Domino server that you want to crawl.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Only the user account that is assigned to the OSearch15 service can be used to crawl Lotus Domino databases. You cannot use the default content access account or a crawl rule to specify a different user account to crawl Lotus Domino databases. 
  
The following table summarizes the user accounts that are required to crawl Lotus Domino databases. 
  
|    **Required account**     |                                                                                                     **Comment**                                                                                                     |                                                         **Example**                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows domain user account | The user account that is assigned to the OSearch15 service must also be a member of the Administrators group on the server that hosts the crawl component.                                                          | Contoso\User1, where Contoso is the domain name and User1 is the name of the Windows domain user account.                   |
| Lotus Notes user ID         | The Lotus Notes user ID must be granted at least Reader access on the Lotus Domino databases and on the individual documents that you want to crawl. The Domino certificate also contains this Lotus Notes user ID. | User2  <br/><br/> **NOTE:** The name of this account and its password do not have to match the Windows domain user account. |
