# Create and import query suggestions for the classic search experience in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
An easy way to help users search for information in SharePoint Server is to create  *query suggestions*  . Query suggestions are words that appear under the search box as users type a query.

SharePoint Server automatically creates a query suggestion when users have clicked a search result for a query at least six times. For example, if users have entered the query word "coffee" and then clicked on a search result six times, then "coffee" automatically becomes a query suggestion. We can also create query spelling suggestions manually. In this article, we'll use a simple example to show how to do this.
    
## How to create a query suggestions file
<a name="BKMK_HowToCreateAQuerySuggestionsFile"> </a>

1. Open a text editor, for example Notepad.
    
2. Enter the query spelling suggestions that you want to add. Add one word or phrase per line.
    
     ![Query Suggestion List](../media/OTCSP_QuerySuggestionList.png)
  
3. Save the file as a **.txt** file and encoding **UTF-8**. 
    
     ![Save as TXT File](../media/OTCSP_SaveTXT.png)
  
Now that you have a query suggestions file, the next task is to import it to SharePoint Server.
  
## How to import a query suggestions file to SharePoint

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185077" target="_blank">**More features** in the SharePoint admin center</a>, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](../../SharePointOnline/sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. 

2. Under **Search**, select **Open**.
  
3. Select **Query Suggestion Settings**. 
    
     ![Select Query Suggestion Settings](../media/OTCSP_QuerySuggestionSettings.png)

6. Select **OK**, and then **Save Settings**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you import query suggestions, existing query suggestions are overwritten. If you haven't previously imported any query suggestions, you have nothing to worry about. Automatically created query suggestions will not be overwritten when you import new ones. But, if you want to import additional query suggestions, you should export the existing query suggestions file, update it, and then reimport it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you have uploaded your query suggestions file, it might take some hours before your query suggestions are displayed. 
  
To verify that your query suggestions are working correctly, in a search box, type two letters of a phrase from your query suggestions file. The query suggestions appear under the search box.
