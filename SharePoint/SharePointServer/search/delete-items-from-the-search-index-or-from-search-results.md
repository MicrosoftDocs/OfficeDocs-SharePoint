# Delete items from the search index or from search results in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
If you want to remove the metadata of an item from the search index or from the search results, you remove the URL of that item. To remove a URL from the search index, use the **Remove the Item from the Index** option that is available through the crawl log. To remove a URL from search results, use the **Search Result Removal** feature that allows for bulk URL removal. This can provide a more efficient method if many search results should be removed. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> 
> - If your SharePoint environment is hybrid and uses [cloud hybrid search](../hybrid/learn-about-cloud-hybrid-search-for-sharepoint.md), you index your on-premises content in your search index in Office 365. See [Learn about cloud hybrid search for SharePoint](../hybrid/learn-about-cloud-hybrid-search-for-sharepoint.md) for guidance on deleting the metadata of an on-premises item and deleting on-premises search results from the search index in Office 365. 
>
> - For SharePoint Server 2019, removing the URL of an item affects both the **classic** and **modern** search experiences.
