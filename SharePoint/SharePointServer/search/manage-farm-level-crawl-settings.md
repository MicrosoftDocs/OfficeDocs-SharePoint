    Change how long the SharePoint Server search crawler will wait for a connection to a content repository or for a response to a connection attempt.
    
- [Configure the crawler in case of SSL certificate warnings in SharePoint Server](configure-the-crawler-in-case-of-ssl-certificate-warnings.md)
    
    Specify whether a SharePoint Server crawler will crawl a site if there is a problem with the site's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.
