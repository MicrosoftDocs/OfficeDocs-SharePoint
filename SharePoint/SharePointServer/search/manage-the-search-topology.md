The following articles provide information about how you manage search components in SharePoint Server.
  
Before you change the search topology, you must define, install and configure the required application servers and database servers that you want to use for search.
  
For information about planning an initial enterprise search architecture, see [Plan enterprise search architecture in SharePoint Server 2016](plan-enterprise-search-architecture.md). To learn which approach to use to scale enterprise search architecture, see [Scale enterprise search in SharePoint Server](scale-enterprise-search.md). For information about planning an initial search architecture for cloud hybrid search, see [Plan your search architecture in SharePoint Server for cloud hybrid search](../hybrid/plan-cloud-hybrid-search-for-sharepoint.md#BKMK_Plan_search_architecture).
  
For example farm architectures and search topologies for internet sites, see the technical diagrams [Internet sites search architectures for SharePoint Server 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54296) and [Search architectures for SharePoint Server 2013](https://docs.com/officeitpro/3386/search-architectures-for-sharepoint-server-2016). You can also find these diagrams in [Technical diagrams for SharePoint Server](../technical-reference/technical-diagrams.md) . [Scale search for Internet sites in SharePoint Server](scale-search-for-internet-sites.md) gives guidance on scaling out search topology for Internet sites.
