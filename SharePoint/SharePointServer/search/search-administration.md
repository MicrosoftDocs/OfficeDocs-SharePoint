# Administer search in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
Below are the main areas where you can customize and impact the search experience for your users and make sure that search is performing the way you want. SharePoint Server 2019 has both a classic and a modern search experience. Both search experiences use the same search index to find search results, and some settings can impact both experiences. [Learn about the differences between the search experiences in SharePoint Server](differences-search-2016-2019.md).

## Make sure the content can be found

The content must be crawled and added to the search index for your users to find what they're looking for when they search in SharePoint Server.

## Make the results in the Search Center look great
The Search Center is a classic search experience, which you can customize. Presenting the search results the right way makes content easier to find. The Search Center comes with several pages, and you can use the different search Web Parts to help each user find what they're looking for.

## Show relevant search results
All search results are not relevant to everyone all the time. There are a number of settings that you can use to show users the most relevant results. [Learn how to manage relevance](manage-relevance.md).

## Check logs and reports
See how you can check if the crawler has added content to the search index, and if your users are finding what they're looking for.

## Manage the search topology
To keep search performant, you might need to scale out the search topology by managing the search components. [Learn how to manage the search topology](manage-the-search-topology.md).
