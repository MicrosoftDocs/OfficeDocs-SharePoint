# Migrate Windows claims to SAML claims

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]  

Identifies the steps required to migrate a web application that is going from Windows claims authentication to SAML-based authentication in SharePoint Server.

## Identity migration ##

To run the identity migration, follow these steps:

**NOTE**:   These steps apply only to existing web applications.

- Generate a skip list- A skip list is comma-separated values file (.csv file) that has records to exclude during the identity migration. For example, it is necessary to exclude certain service applications or certain domain accounts
- Run the migration against the web application that has one or more content databases.

## Migration of a web application ##

To migrate a web application to include all the content databases by using Windows PowerShell.

1. Check that you have the following memberships:

- The securityadmin fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.
- The db_owner fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.
- The Administrators group on the server on which you are running Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
- Read [about_Execution_Policies](/previous-versions//dd347641(v=technet.10)).

An administrator can use the **Add-SPShellAdmin** cmdlet to grant permissions to use SharePoint cmdlets.

**NOTE**:   If you do not have permissions, contact your Setup administrator or SQL Server administrator to request permissions. For additional information about Windows PowerShell permissions, see Permissions and [Add-SPShellAdmin](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/add-spshelladmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

2. To migrate a web application to include all content databases, type the following at the Windows PowerShell command prompt.

```powershell
$skipFile = "FileName.csv"
$wa = Get-SPWebApplication -Identity "Name of web application"
$tp = Get-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer "RegularUsers"
Convert-SPWebApplication -Identity $wa -From CLAIMS-WINDOWS -To CLAIMS-TRUSTED-DEFAULT -TrustedProvider $tp -SourceSkipList $skipFile
```

To migrate specific web applications and content databases by using Windows PowerShell.

1. Check that you have the following memberships:
- The securityadmin fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.
- The db_owner fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.
- The Administrators group on the server on which you are running Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
- Read [about_Execution_Policies](/previous-versions//dd347641(v=technet.10)).

An administrator can use the Add-SPShellAdmin cmdlet to grant permissions to use SharePoint cmdlets.

**NOTE**:   If you do not have permissions, contact your Setup administrator or SQL Server administrator to request permissions. For additional information about Windows PowerShell permissions, see Permissions and [Add-SPShellAdmin](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/add-spshelladmin?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).

 
2. To migrate specific web applications and content databases, type the following at the Windows PowerShell command prompt.

```powershell
$skipFile = "FileName.csv"
$wa = Get-SPWebApplication -Identity "Name of web application"
$database = Get-SPContentDatabase -Identity "DB_Name"
Convert-SPWebApplication -Identity $wa -Database $database -From CLAIMS-WINDOWS -To CLAIMS-TRUSTED-DEFAULT -SourceSkipList $skipFile
```

If you want to reverse the migration process, type the following at the Windows PowerShell command prompt.

```powershell
$skipFile = "FileName.csv"
$wa = Get-SPWebApplication -Identity "Name of web application"
Convert-SPWebApplication -Identity $wa -From CLAIMS-TRUSTED-DEFAULT -To CLAIMS-WINDOWS -SourceSkipList $skipFile -Database $database 
```

**NOTE**:   For more information, see [Get-SPContentDatabase](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/get-spcontentdatabase?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true), [Get-SPWebApplication](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/get-spwebapplication?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true), and [Convert-SPWebApplication](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/convert-spwebapplication?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true).
