# Plan for administrative and service accounts in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
To install SharePoint Server, you have to have appropriate administrative and service accounts on servers running SharePoint Server and SQL Server. After installation, you need to have appropriate administrative and service accounts to modify and maintain the environment. The accounts that you require to complete these groups of tasks are not necessarily the same. This article describes the accounts that you require after installation for a single-server environment and a server farm environment.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use service account names that contain the symbol $ with the exception of using a Group Managed Service Account for SQL Server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SharePoint services do not support Active Directory Managed Service Accounts or Group Managed Service Accounts.
    
Use this article along with [Initial deployment administrative and service accounts in SharePoint Server](../install/initial-deployment-administrative-and-service-accounts-in-sharepoint-server.md).
  
The initial deployment administrative and service accounts article describes the specific account and permissions that you need to grant prior to running Setup. 
  
This article does not describe the account requirements for using Secure Store service in SharePoint Server. For more information, see [Plan the Secure Store Service in SharePoint Server](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-server-2010/ee806889(v=office.14)).

## About administrative and service accounts
<a name="Section1"> </a>

This section lists and describes the accounts for which you must plan to manage servers running SQL Server or SharePoint Server. The accounts are grouped according to scope. 
  
After you complete installation and configuration of accounts, ensure that you do not use the Local System account to perform administration tasks or to browse sites. 
  
### Server farm-level accounts

The following table describes the accounts that are used to configure SQL Server database software and to install SharePoint Server.
  
|**Account**|**Purpose**|**Requirements**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|SQL Server service account| The SQL Server service account is used to run SQL Server. It is the service account for the following SQL Server services:  <br/>  MSSQLSERVER  <br/>  SQLSERVERAGENT  <br/>  If you do not use the default SQL Server instance, in the Windows Services console, these services will be shown as:  <br/>  MSSQL\<InstanceName\>  <br/>  SQLAgent\<InstanceName\>|Use either a domain user account or preferably, a [Group Managed Service Account](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview).  <br/> If you plan to back up to or restore from an external resource, permissions to the external resource must be granted to the appropriate account. If you use a domain user account or Group Managed Service Account for the SQL Server service account, grant permissions to that domain user account. However, if you use the Network Service or the Local System account, grant permissions to the external resource to the machine account (\<domain_name\>\\<SQL_hostname\>).  <br/> The instance name is arbitrary and was created when SQL Server was installed.|
|Farm administrator user account| The farm administrator user account is a uniquely identifiable account assigned to a SharePoint admin. It is used to run:  <br/>  Setup  <br/>  SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard| Domain user account.  <br/>  Member of the Administrators group on each SharePoint server in the farm.  <br/>  Member of the following SQL Server role (optional): **sysadmin** fixed server role.  <br/>  If you run Windows PowerShell cmdlets that affect a database, this account must be a member of the **db_owner** fixed database role for the database or a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role on SQL.|
|Farm service account| The farm service account is used to perform the following tasks:  <br/>  Act as the application pool identity for the SharePoint Central Administration website.  <br/>  Run the Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Workflow Timer Service.  | Domain user account.  <br/>  More permissions are automatically granted for the server farm account on Web servers and application servers that are joined to a server farm.  <br/>  The server farm account is automatically added as a SQL Server login on the computer that runs SQL Server. The account is added to the following SQL Server security roles:  <br/> * **dbcreator** fixed server role  <br/> * **securityadmin** fixed server role  <br/> * **db_owner** fixed database role for all SharePoint databases in the server farm  <br/> This account must not be used interactively by an administrator. <br/>Modify farm service account will need to restart IIS server by using `iisreset.exe` command. |
   
### Service application accounts

The following table describes the accounts that are used to set up and configure a service application.
  
For more information about service application endpoints, see [Using Service Endpoints](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee535060(v=office.14)).

### SharePoint Web Applications

A single account should be used for all Web Applications, named Web Application pool account. This condition allows the administrator to use a single IIS Application Pool for all Web Applications, which increases performance and reduces memory usage on the server.
  
|**Account**|**Purpose**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Application pool identity|The user account that the worker processes that service the application pool use as their process identity. This account is used to access content databases that are associated with the web applications that reside in the application pool.|
   
## Single-server standard requirements
<a name="Section2"> </a>

If you are deploying to a single server, account requirements are greatly reduced. In an evaluation environment, you can use a single account for all of the account purposes. In a production environment, ensure that the accounts that you create have the appropriate permissions for their purposes. 
  
For a list of account permissions for single-server environments, see [Initial deployment administrative and service accounts in SharePoint Server](../install/initial-deployment-administrative-and-service-accounts-in-sharepoint-server.md).
  
## Server farm requirements
<a name="Section3"> </a>

If you are deploying to more than one server, use the server farm standard requirements to ensure that accounts have the appropriate permissions to perform their processes across multiple computers. The server farm standard requirements detail the minimum configuration that is necessary to operate in a server farm environment.
  
For a list of standard requirements for server farm environments, see the requirements listed in the [Technical reference: Account requirements by scenario](#Section7) section of this article. 
  
For some accounts, additional permissions or access to databases is configured when you run the Configuration Wizard. These extra privileges are noted in the accounts planning tool. An important configuration for database administrators to be aware of is the addition of the **WSS_Content_Application_Pools** database role. The Configuration Wizard adds this role to the following databases: 
  
- SharePoint_Config database (configuration database)
    
- SharePoint_Admin content database
    
Members of the **WSS_Content_Application_Pools** database role are granted the Execute permission to a subset of the stored procedures for the database. Additionally, members of this role are granted the Select permission to the Versions table (dbo.Versions) in the SharePoint_AdminContent database. 
  
For other databases, the accounts planning tool indicates that access to read from these databases is automatically configured. In some cases, limited access to write to a database is also automatically configured. To provide this access, permissions to stored procedures are configured.

### Single-server standard requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We do not recommend this configuration in a production environment.

#### Server farm-level accounts

This restriction is designed to prevent elevation of privilege for any other process running as the Local System account.|
|Default Content Access|No manual configuration is necessary if this account is only crawling local farm content. If you want to crawl remote content by using crawl rules, change this account to a domain user one, and apply the requirements listed for a server farm.|
