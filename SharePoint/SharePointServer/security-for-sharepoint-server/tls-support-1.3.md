# Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 Support

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

TLS 1.3 is the latest version of the TLS encryption protocol. SharePoint Server Subscription Edition by default supports TLS 1.3 when deployed with Windows Server 2022 and 2021-06 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 3.5, and 4.8 for Microsoft server operating system x64 (KB5003529).

> [!NOTE]
> TLS 1.3 does not require any additional configuration and may not support all softwares and systems. Microsoft recommends you to contact your software and hardware administrator to check compatibility of TLS 1.3.
>
> TLS 1.3 is not available and is not supported when SharePoint Server Subscription Edition is deployed with earlier versions of Windows Server. Microsoft recommends deploying SharePoint Server Subscription Edition with Windows Server 2022 or higher.
