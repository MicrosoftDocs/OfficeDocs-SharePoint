# Configure the Microsoft OneDrive modern user experience

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-2016-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-2016-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)]
  
As part of the November 2016 public update for SharePoint Server 2016 (Feature Pack 1), a new modern user experience for Microsoft OneDrive is included. This modern user experience is turned on automatically when you install the public update. However, you can use Microsoft PowerShell to toggle the user experience off and on if you need to.
  
The OneDrive modern user experience requires an active [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default.aspx) contract at the time it is enabled, either by installation of the PU or by manual enablement. If you don't have an active Software Assurance contract at the time of enablement, then you must turn the OneDrive modern user experience off.
  
 **Turn the OneDrive modern user experience off**
  
Make sure you have [permissions to administer SharePoint Server with Windows PowerShell](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true), and log in to a server in your SharePoint farm. Open the SharePoint 2016 Management Shell as administrator and run the following script:
  
```
$Farm = Get-SPFarm
$Farm.OneDriveUserExperienceVersion = [Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.OneDriveUserExperienceVersion]::Version1
$Farm.Update()

```
