# Edit existing web parts in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
SharePoint Server web parts can be edited to change their view, appearance, layout and other properties. Editing a SharePoint Server web part can be fast and simple, and done right on the page where the web part is found. The procedure for editing a SharePoint Server web part is the same for all web parts, but the editable properties for each may be different. In all cases you'll be using your Web browser and be working on each SharePoint Server web part individually. This topic will cover this common procedure and describe the overall process for SharePoint Server web part editing. Specific properties for each web part will not be covered as help for these is available from right inside your browser on your SharePoint Server site page. 

The SharePoint Server 2019 modern experience includes the Team, Community, and Communication sites. These pages are pre-populated with unique web parts, like the Hero, News, Events, and Documents web parts. For more information, see [Classic and modern web part experiences](https://support.office.com/article/3fdae6c3-8fc1-49ab-8708-8c104b882e64) and [Using web parts on SharePoint pages](https://support.office.com/article/336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0).
  
## Editing a SharePoint Server 2016 web part

The procedure for editing a SharePoint Server web part involves editing the page the web part is on, and then editing the web part itself. This procedure is the same for all web parts and can be used on any web parts on the page you edit. Keep in mind, since that this procedure describes how to edit any web part, it covers only the procedure to take you to the step where the web part is ready to edit and its properties are available for editing, it will not describe any of the properties available for editing for any specific web part. Specific web part property information is available for many web parts individually on the page you're editing using the SharePoint Server online help found right next to your username and the settings **Gear** icon on every SharePoint Server page in the form of a **Question Mark** icon. 
  
 **How to edit web parts**
  
1. Confirm that you have administrative rights to the page and all web parts you will edit.
    
2. Browse to the SharePoint Server site that contains the web part or parts you will edit. 
    
3. On the SharePoint Ribbon, select the **Page** tab. 
    
4. Select **Edit**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice that all web parts on the page now display borders and are individually selectable. 
  
5. Move your mouse over the upper right corner of the web part you will edit. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice that a small drop-down arrow and a check-box become visible when you hover over the corner. The check-box allows you to select the web part. When the check-box is selected the web part tab shows in the Ribbon and allows several options including viewing the **Web Part Properties**, **Minimize**, and the option to **Delete** the web part. 
  
6. The drop-down arrow allows similar choices with the addition of the **Export** option. Export allows you to save the entire selected Web-Part in the **.webpart** file format for import and use on another page or SharePoint Server site. 
    
7. The editable properties for the selected web part are available by selecting **Web Part Properties**, from the **Web Part** tab in the Ribbon, or **Edit Web Part** from the drop-down arrow. 
    
8. That's it. You're editing a SharePoint Server web part. 
    
9. When you've completed editing, to save your work and return to the normal page view, select the **Page** tab in the Ribbon, and then click **Save**. This will save your work and exit the edit mode and return you to your normal page view.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If you've made a mistake, or aren't happy with the revisions you've made to the page or its web parts, you can choose to **Stop Editing** and then **Discard changes**. Select the **Page** tab in the **Ribbon**, and then select the drop-down arrow below the **Save** icon. Select **Stop Editing**, the **Save Changes** dialog appears. Select **Discard changes**. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> One last thing, the SharePoint Server online help available via the help icon question mark. This help is available for all elements on the page, including web parts. When you have selected a web part, if you want additional help, click the help icon question mark and a SharePoint Help window will open. The default topics will display for the item on the page you've selected and you can search for additional topics. For web parts the search terms **Configure Web Part** will return many related results.
