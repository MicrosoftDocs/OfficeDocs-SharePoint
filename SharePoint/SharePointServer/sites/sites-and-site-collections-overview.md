# Overview of sites and site collections in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

A site collection is made up of one top-level site and all sites below it. As shown in the following figure, it is the top level of organization in a SharePoint Server web application. The number of site collections you can have in a single web application depends on the capacity of your server infrastructure. For more information about SharePoint Server boundaries, see [Software boundaries and limits for SharePoint Servers 2016 and 2019](../install/software-boundaries-limits-2019.md).

**Figure: Structure of a site collection in SharePoint Server 2016**

![Diagram of a site collection](../media/DiagramOfSiteCollection.gif)

The SharePoint Server 2019 modern experience is similar to the experience in SharePoint in Microsoft 365. The main difference is Hub sites aren't available in SharePoint Server. We do recommend that you use the same process as in SharePoint in Microsoft 365, create site collections for each unit of work instead of creating subsites. These site collections will make it easier when migrating your SharePoint farm to SharePoint in Microsoft 365.

The following guidelines show the relationship between SharePoint Server sites and site collections, and content databases:

- All content in a site collection must be stored in a single content database. You can't store a site collection's content across multiple content databases.

- You can scale up content databases that support a site collection. You can also scale out a content database at the web application level to support more site collections.

- A site collection can exist in only one content database, but one content database can host the content for multiple site collections.

- A site can't exist outside of a site collection and can only exist in one site collection but a site collection can host many sites.

## Overview of SharePoint site collections
<a name="section1"> </a>

You create a site collection to host sites that have something in common. For example, the sites might be in a common administrative boundary or share common branding. The site collection might be created to house all the sites and content for a business unit. Or, a single site collection might have become too large to manage, and it must be split into smaller ones. Lastly, some site collections are created exclusively to host specific SharePoint Server functionality, such as Enterprise Search Center or to host My Sites. Site collections are a way of organizing sites for a common purpose. We recommend that you create site collections for each unit of work instead of creating subsites.

SharePoint Server supports two types of site collections: host-named site collections and path-based site collections. In a path-based site collection, all the subsites in the site collection will share a root or parent URL (DNS name). For example, Team A could have a site collection at http<!-- nolink -->://contoso.com/sites/teamA, and Team B would have a site collection at http<!-- nolink -->://contoso/sites/teamB. All sites in either site collection would have the http<!-- nolink -->://contoso.com/sites/teamA or /teamB root. The only way to have a different URL root is to create a different web application.

To better align with SharePoint best practices, use host-named site collections. The host-named site collections allow you to assign custom names to each site collection that you create in a web application. For example, you can have two site collections in the same web application addressed like this: http<!-- nolink -->://TeamA.contoso.com and http<!-- nolink -->://TeamB.contoso.com. This scenario is much more scalable and has been heavily tested in SharePoint.

Because site collections and sites exist in a parent-child relationship, there are aspects of control and functionality that can be configured at the site collection level and used at the site level. This aspect management pattern provides many benefits as follows:

- For site designers, a site collection's galleries and libraries (such as the Master Page Gallery or the Site Collection Images library) provide a means for creating a unified, branded user experience across all sites in the site collection.

- For site collection administrators, a site collection provides a unified mechanism and scope for administration. For example, security, policies, and features can be managed for a whole site collection; Site Collection Web Analytics Reports, audit log reports, and other data can help administrators track site collection security and performance.

  SharePoint Server 2019 offers the choice to create modern Team and Communication sites like in SharePoint in Microsoft 365, or keep the classic experience. Using the modern experience site collections is inline with our recommendation to create site collections for each unit of work to make it easier when you decide to migrate to SharePoint.

- For farm administrators, site collections can be moved between content databases. By this movement, farm administrators can manage the size of their content databases.

- For site authors, shared site columns, content types, web parts, authoring resources, workflows, and other site collection features provide a consistent authoring environment.

- For site users, a site collection's unified navigation, branding, and search tools provide a unified website experience.

Every site collection starts as a single, top-level site. Because it is a site, its structure and functionality is based on a site template. SharePoint Server provides many site templates, plus you can also create and use your own as needed. The following tables describe the site collection templates that are available in SharePoint Servers 2016 and 2019.

> [!NOTE]
> The Web Databases site templates that are available through the 2010 experience sites in SharePoint 2013 are no longer available in the 2013 experience sites in SharePoint 2013. In SharePoint Server 2016, you create an Access database by creating a new app, instead of creating a site.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some SharePoint 2010 Products site templates, such as the Document Workspace Site templates, were deprecated and are not available as an option in SharePoint 2013. Existing sites that were created by using these deprecated site templates and then upgraded will continue to operate in SharePoint 2013. The deprecated site templates will be removed completely from the next version of SharePoint.

Examples of solutions that benefit from being implemented as site collections are as follows:

- **Team collaboration site** A site collection to support authoring and collaboration tasks. Often, this kind of site includes collaborative content that is not published but only used internally. For example, a team collaboration site collection might contain a site for each team in your organization to use to plan projects, coordinate tasks, record meeting notes, and store team documents.

- **Published Internet site** A site collection for publishing content to anonymous Internet readers. A small number of authors create and publish content for many readers. For example, you might use a published Internet site to provide information about company products or services to customers. You can implement publishing sites in a single site collection, where authoring and publishing tasks are performed on the same site. You can also implement publishing sites as two or more site collections that separate the stages of authoring and publishing. Content is created on one or more authoring site collections, and is displayed on one or more publishing site collections by using the Cross-Site Collection Publishing feature in SharePoint Server. For information about how to decide which publishing method to use, see [Plan for Internet, intranet, and extranet publishing sites in SharePoint Server](../administration/plan-for-internet-intranet-and-extranet-publishing-sites.md). For information about cross-site publishing, see [Plan for cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server](../administration/plan-for-cross-site-publishing.md).

## Overview of SharePoint sites
<a name="section2"> </a>

You create sites in your site collection to partition your content so that you can have finer control of the appearance and the permission to the content. You can also have different features available on the various sites in your site collection. You can use a site template with its default configuration, or you can change the site's default settings through site administration, and then save the site as a new template. For more information, see [Create and use site templates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394630).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot save a SharePoint publishing site collection or site as a template. If you activate the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature on a non-publishing site collection, the **Save site as template** link is removed from the **Site Actions** section on the **Site Settings** page.

You can configure the following items for a site:

- **Templates** Sites in a site collection can each use different templates.

- **Language** If language packs were installed on the web server, you can select a specific language to use together with the site template when you create a new site. The user interface that appears on the site is displayed in the language that was selected when the site was created. Content and other items created by users are displayed in the language in which they are created. For more information, see [Plan for multilingual sites in SharePoint Server](plan-for-multilingual-sites.md) and [Install or uninstall language packs for SharePoint Servers 2016 and 2019](../install/install-uninstall-language-packs-2019.md).

- **Security** You can define unique user groups and permissions for each site.

- **Navigation** You can fine-tune your site's navigation experience by configuring unique navigation links in each part of your site's hierarchy. Site navigation often reflects the relationships among the sites in a site collection. Therefore, planning navigation and planning sites structures are closely related activities. For more information, see [Overview of site navigation in SharePoint Server](site-navigation-overview.md).

    In SharePoint Server publishing sites, you can use managed navigation to create a site navigation that is derived from a tightly managed taxonomy. For more information, see [Overview of managed navigation in SharePoint Server](../administration/overview-of-managed-navigation.md).

- **Web pages** Each site can have a unique welcome page and other pages.

- **Site layouts** Each site can have a unique layout or master pages.

- **Themes** You can change colors and fonts on a site. For more information, see [Overview of themes in SharePoint Server](themes-overview.md).

- **Regional settings** Each site can have custom regional settings, such as locale, time zone, sort order, time format, and calendar type.

- **Search** Each site can have custom search settings. For example, you can specify that a particular site never appears in search results.

- **Content types** Each site can have unique content types and site columns.

- **Workflows** You can make each site have unique workflows.

- **Apps** You can install apps for SharePoint to deliver specific information or functionality to a SharePoint site. An app for SharePoint is a small, easy-to-use, stand-alone application that solves a specific end-user or business need.
