# User permissions and permission levels in SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
Default permission levels are predefined sets of permissions that you can assign to individual users, groups of users, or security groups, based on the functional requirements of the users and on security considerations. SharePoint Server permission levels are defined at the site collection level and are inherited from the parent object by default.

Learn about [Sharing and permissions in the SharePoint modern experience in Microsoft 365](../../SharePointOnline/modern-experience-sharing-permissions.md).
    
## Default permission levels
<a name="section1"> </a>

Default permission levels are made up of a set of permissions that enable users to perform a collection of related tasks. SharePoint Server includes seven permission levels. You can customize the permissions contained within five of these permission levels. You cannot customize the permissions within the Limited Access and Full Control permission levels.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Although you cannot directly edit the Limited Access and Full Control permission levels, you can make individual permissions unavailable for the entire web application, which removes those permissions from the Limited Access and Full Control permission levels. For more information, see [Manage permissions for a web application in SharePoint Server](../administration/manage-permissions-for-a-web-application.md). 
  
The following table lists the default permission levels for team sites in SharePoint Server.
  
| Permission level | Description | Permissions included by default |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|View Only  |Enables users to view application pages. The View Only permission level is used for the Excel Services Viewers group.  | View Application Pages  <br/>  View Items  <br/>  View Versions  <br/>  Create Alerts  <br/>  Use Self Service Site Creation  <br/>  View Pages  <br/>  Browse User Information  <br/>  Use Remote Interfaces  <br/>  Use Client Integration Features  <br/>  Open  |
|Limited Access  |Enables users to access shared resources and a specific asset. Limited Access is designed to be combined with fine-grained permissions to enable users to access a specific list, document library, folder, list item, or document, without enabling them to access the whole site. Limited Access cannot be edited or deleted. Note: when sharing a link to a document with all users in your organization, SharePoint will assign the Limited Access permission via a group name "Limited Access System Group" that is applied the first time a user accesses the resource who does not otherwise have permission via the link  | View Application Pages  <br/>  Browse User Information  <br/>  Use Remote Interfaces  <br/>  Use Client Integration Features  <br/>  Open  |
|Read  |Enables users to view pages and list items, and to download documents.  | Limited Access permissions, plus:  <br/>  View Items  <br/>  Open Items  <br/>  View Versions  <br/>  Create Alerts  <br/>  Use Self-Service Site Creation  <br/>  View Pages  |

|Full Control  |Enables users to have full control of the website.  |All permissions  |
   
If you use a site template other than the team site template, you will see a different list of default SharePoint permission levels. For example, the following table shows additional permission levels provided with the publishing template.
  
| Permission level | Description | Permissions included by default |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|

## User permissions
<a name="section2"> </a>

SharePoint Server includes 33 permissions, which are used in the default permission levels. You can configure which permissions are included in a particular permission level (except for the Limited Access and Full Control permission levels), or you can create a new permission level to contain specific permissions.
  
Permissions are categorized as list permissions, site permissions, and personal permissions, depending on the objects to which they can be applied. For example, site permissions apply to a particular site, list permissions apply only to lists and libraries, and personal permissions apply only to certain objects, such as personal views and private Web Parts. The following tables describe what each permission is used for, the dependent permissions, and the permission levels in which it is included.
