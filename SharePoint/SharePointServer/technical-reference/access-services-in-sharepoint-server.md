 **Summary:** During application creation, Access Data services cannot find an available SQL Server to provision the new database. 
  
### Cause

No SQL database servers are configured for Access to provision new databases.
  
### Resolution

- If the creation failure occurs while creating from the Access client, check the Database Server group mappings to determine where the shortage has occurred:
    
  - Use  `Get-SPAccessServicesDatabaseServerGroupMapping` to determine whether there is a mapping from the Object Model to the Server Group. 
    
  - Use  `Get-SPAccessServicesDatabaseServerGroup` to determine whether the server group has at least one database. 
    
  - Use  `Get-SPAccessServicesDatabaseServer` to determine whether there is at least one database in the server group marked as "AvailableForCreate". 
    
- If the creation failure occurs while creating from the Corporate Catalog, check the Database Server group mappings to determine where the shortage has occurred:
    
  - Use  `Get-SPAccessServicesDatabaseServerGroupMapping` to determine whether there is a mapping from the Corporate Catalog to the Server Group. 
    
  - Use  `Get-SPAccessServicesDatabaseServerGroup` to determine whether the server group has at least one database. 
    
  - Use  `Get-SPAccessServicesDatabaseServer` to determine whether there is at least one database in the server group marked as "AvailableForCreate".
