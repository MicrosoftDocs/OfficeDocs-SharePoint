# Accounts used by application pools or service identities are in the local machine Administrators group (SharePoint Server)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 
  
 **Rule Name:** Accounts used by application pools or service identities are in the local machine Administrators group. 
  
 **Summary:** A user account that is used by application pools or services must have permissions of a domain user account and must not be a member of the Farm Administrators group or a member of the Administrators group on the local computer. Using highly privileged accounts for application pools or services poses a security risk to the farm, and could allow malicious code to execute. 
  
 **Cause:** Accounts that are used by application pools or services are members of the Administrators group on the local computer. 
  
 **Resolution: Change the user account to a predefined account, or to a domain user account that is not a member of the Administrators group.**
  
1. Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Farm Administrators group.
    
2. On the Central Administration home page, in the **Security** section, click **Configure service accounts**.
    
3. On the Service Accounts page, in the **Select the component to update** list, click the application pool or service that uses the credentials of a member of the Administrators group on the local computer as its security account. 
    
4. In the **Select an account** list, click an appropriate account for this component — for example, the predefined account **Network Service** — or click **Register new managed account**, and then on the Register Managed Account page, specify the credentials and the password change settings that you want.
    
5. Click **OK**.
