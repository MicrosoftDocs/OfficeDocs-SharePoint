## How site columns become managed properties
<a name="BKMK_FromSiteColumnsToManagedProperties"> </a>

When you add columns to a SharePoint library or list, you can choose to add regular columns or site columns. For information about the difference between regular columns and site columns, see [Introduction to columns](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ms450825(v=office.14)). In SharePoint, only site columns that contain values will automatically become managed properties when they are crawled. Regular columns will not automatically become managed properties when they are crawled.
  
Before you can share content in a library or list with other site collections, you must share the library or list as a catalog, and then start a full crawl of the content. For more information, see "Share a library or list as a catalog" in [Configure cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server](../administration/configure-cross-site-publishing.md).
  
During the crawl of library content, the following actions are performed on the site columns:
  
1. A crawled property is created. Spaces are removed from the site column name, and then the following prefixes are added to the site column name to create the crawled property name:
    
   - For site columns of type **Publishing HTML** and **Multiple line of text**: ows_r_ _\<four letter code\>__
    
   - For site columns of type **Managed Metadata**: ows_taxId_
    
   - For all other site column types: ows_q_ _\<four letter code\>__
    
2. A managed property is created and mapped to the corresponding crawled property. Spaces are removed from the site column name, and the following items are added to the site column name to create the managed property name:
    
   - For all site columns of type **Managed Metadata**, the following prefix is added: owstaxId
    
   - For all other site column types, the following suffix is added: OWS _ \<four letter code\> _
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The four letter code represents the site column type, not the managed property type. All automatically created managed properties are of type Text. 
  
**Examples of automatically created crawled property names and managed property names for site columns without special characters**

**Data format for Managed Metadata.**
  
To query for items tagged with a Managed Metadata field, you have to use the Unique Identifier for each label. You can find the Unique Identifier for each term in a term set in the Term Store Management Tool, on the **GENERAL** tab. In addition, the data format that is used in the query has to specify from which level in the term set the query should apply. This specification is set by adding one of the following prefixes to the Unique Identifier: 
  
- To query for all items that are tagged with a term: GP0|# 
    
- To query for all items that are tagged with a child of term: GPP|#
    
- To query for all items that are tagged with a term from a term set: GTSet|#
    
For example, let's say that you have a catalog of restaurants around the world. The catalog has a managed metadata site column named Location, which is tied to the term set named World. The term set has the following structure (the GUID for each term is shown in parentheses): 
  
- World (`fc01ae6d-8ed3-4872-9cef-d2199d52d61c`)
    
    - India (`c8a43f13-5ea1-45f2-b46d-3a1986a1cbd7`)
    
        - Mumbai (`ad491ed9-c21c-46d9-896c-c0d148957c60`)
    
        - Delhi (`c195b6e0-9062-446a-9af1-8ec1a642fede`)
    
    - France (`17587ed2-8433-45a4-9f4b-6825164fcd09`)
    
         - Paris (`01031cfe-2492-47f1-8723-45c63ef70ec9`)
    
         - Lyon (`3b2137a9-3c3a-4676-a50a-14f72ab29175`)
    
The catalog entries and examples of queries are shown in the following tables. 
  
**Catalog entries for restaurants and locations**

| Restaurant | Location |
|:-----|:-----|
|Restaurant 1   |Mumbai   |
|Restaurant 2   |Mumbai   |
|Restaurant 3   |Delhi   |
|Restaurant 4   |Paris   |
|Restaurant 5   |Lyon   |
   
**Query examples**

| Query for | Data format | Query will return |&nbsp;|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|All restaurants in Mumbai   |GP0|#ad491ed9-c21c-46d9-896c-c0d148957c60   |Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2   |
|All restaurants in Delhi   |GP0|#c195b6e0-9062-446a-9af1-8ec1a642fede   |Restaurant 3   |
|All restaurants in India   |GPP|#c8a43f13-5ea1-45f2-b46d-3a1986a1cbd7   |Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2, Restaurant 3   |
|All restaurants in the World   |GTSet|#fc01ae6d-8ed3-4872-9cef-d2199d52d61c   |Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2, Restaurant 3, Restaurant 4, Restaurant 5   |
   
To display values by label — for example, Mumbai — you have to use the prefix L0|.
  
## Special characters and non-supported characters
<a name="BKMK_SpecialCharacters"> </a>

If a site column name contains diacritics, such as the German umlaut, or a non-supported character, such as #, these characters are included in the crawled property name, but not in the managed property name.
  
**Examples of automatically created crawled property names and managed property names for site columns with special or non-supported characters**
