# Certificate notification contacts haven't been configured

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)] 

 **Rule Name:** Certificate notification contacts haven't been configured.
  
 **Summary:** SSL certificates have been assigned to resources in this SharePoint farm. However, no contacts have been configured to receive email notifications when those certificates are about to expire. Email notifications remind certificate contacts to renew or replace certificates before they expire.
  
 **Cause:** SSL certificates have been assigned to resources in the farm but no certificate notification contacts have been configured.
  
 **Resolution: Configure at least one certificate notification contact from the Configure Certificate Management Settings page in Central Administration.**
