# Dedicated crawl target configuration has one or more invalid servers (SharePoint Server)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
 **Rule Name:** Dedicated crawl target configuration has one or more invalid servers. 
  
 **Summary:** Dedicated crawl target configuration has one or more invalid servers. This may degrade search crawl performance. 
  
 **Cause:** The URI is incorrect, or the server is not joined with a valid role to the SharePoint farm. 
  
 **Resolution: Make sure the uniform resource identifier (URI) is correct, and the server is joined with a valid role to the SharePoint farm.**
  
1. Make sure that the URI is correct. A valid URI meets the following criteria:
    
  - The host portion of the URI should be the name of a server that has joined the SharePoint farm.
    
  - The URI Scheme should be HTTP.
    
  - The URI must not contain an absolute path.
    
    For more information, see [URI class](/dotnet/api/system.uri).
    
2. Make sure that the server is joined with a valid role to the SharePoint farm. The server can be any of the following:
    
  - Front-end
    
  - Application server
    
  - Distributed cache
    
  - Search
    
  - Custom
    
  - Single-server farm or a stand-alone server in the SharePoint farm
