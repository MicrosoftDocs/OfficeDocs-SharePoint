[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
 **Rule Name:** Immediate translations for the Machine Translation service are disabled. 
  
 **Summary:** There are several features in SharePoint Server that rely on the Machine Translation Service synchronous translation mode. If immediate translations are disabled, these features don't function correctly. 
  
 **Cause:** Synchronous translations for the Machine Translation service are disabled. 
  
 **Resolution: Enable synchronous translations for the Machine Translation service.**
  
1. Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Farm Administrators group.
    
2. On the SharePoint Central Administration website, in the **Application Management** section, click **Manage service applications**.
    
3. On the Manage Service Applications page, in the list of service applications, click **Machine Translation Service**.
    
4. In the **Maximum Synchronous Translation Requests** section, type a value that ranges from 1 to 1000 in the **Maximum number of synchronous translation requests (per server)** text box. A value of 0 indicates that synchronous translations are disabled.
