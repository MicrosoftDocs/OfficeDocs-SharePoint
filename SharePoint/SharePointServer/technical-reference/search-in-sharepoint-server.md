## Search Admin Platform Services: Repository Initialization Failed
<a name="ReposInit"> </a>

 **Alert Name:** Search Admin Platform Services: Repository Initialization Failed 
  
 **Summary:** The PackageManager service in each component will read the Default-manifest.txt on component startup to find the current status of the repository quickly. While running, the PackageManager in each component obtains updates about installs and uninstalls from the host controller. In this case, the repository could not be initialized. This means that there was a failure when the repository was initializing on host controller startup. For example, during a primary failover or during a repository reset. 
  
### Cause

The cause could be an ACL issue or a corrupted repository manifest file. If it is a corrupted repository with a good manifest file, initialization will try to rebuild the repository again. However, the same event is also sent when rebuild fails.
  
### Resolution

1. Check for potential ACL issues. 
    
2. Follow this procedure for fixing the repository on secondary (not primary) hosts:
    
  - Stop the host controller.
    
  - Delete the directory C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office Servers\15.0\Data\Office Server\Applications\Search\Repository.
    
  - Start the host controller. This will affect the host controller to create an empty repository with a GUID that does not match the primary. So, the secondary will immediately start to replicate the contents of the primary.
    
## Search Admin Platform Services: Repository Installation Failed
<a name="ReposInstall"> </a>

 **Alert Name:** Search Admin Platform Services: Repository Installation Failed 
  
 **Summary:** Repository installation fails for the file indicated. When dictionary installation fails for the primary, users should be aware that linguistic features such as query suggestions might get outdated. 
  
### Cause

The file may already be installed in the repository, or the related timer job may have failed.
  
### Resolution

Check the repository. Make sure that a dictionary compilation timer job has completed successfully after the event. You can manually trigger the timer job from Central Administration or by using Microsoft PowerShell in order to re-install.
  
## Search Admin Platform Services: Repository Replication
<a name="ReposRep"> </a>

 **Alert Name:** Search Admin Platform Services: Repository Replication 
  
 **Summary:** This situation occurs in secondary repositories. The repository in the local host controller has found that it has a lower repository version than the primary host controller (or lower version than other secondary host controllers if the primary is down). When this happens, the local repository attempts to obtain the latest version from the primary or a secondary based on how it is triggered. This indicates that something went wrong during the replication. 
  
### Cause

Connection to the remote repository which is being replicated can be lost due to a network issue or due to a remote repository (host controller) issue during replication. The local repository can be corrupted or have an ACL issue.
  
### Resolution

If persistent, a manual intervention might require to make it correct based on the problem (see cause). Except for the obvious resolutions on network and ACL and so on, remote host controller can be restarted. If the repository is corrupted, usually it is automatically rebuilt.

## Search Gatherer: Disk Full Crawler
<a name="DiskFull"> </a>

 **Alert Name:** Search Gatherer: Disk Full Crawler 
  
 **Summary:** As the crawler crawls content, it creates files in a temporary location. This temporary location can grow over time. The disk where the temporary location is located is running out of space. SharePoint experiences the following symptoms when this happens: 
  
- The crawl does not progress and seems to stall.
    
- The crawl logs show no new crawled documents.
    
### Cause

The disk on which the crawler creates temporary files is running out of space.
  
### Resolution

- Free up space on the disk on which the crawler creates the temporary files. To free up disk space: Use Disk Cleanup to delete temporary files on the drive where the temporary index files are stored. Use the procedure following this one to determine the location of the index files.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the temporary files are located on a drive other than the operating system drive (drive C), you must restart the search service to test the performance of the crawler after you delete the temporary files. 
  
- After Disk Cleanup is complete, test the performance of the crawler. 
    
- If the crawler is not crawling content, delete unnecessary files and folders on the selected drive.
    
- If you cannot clear any disk space, restart the search service. Restarting the search service recreates the Temp directory for crawled files. In a Command Prompt window, run the command  `net stop osearch15` to stop the search service. Run the command  `net start osearch15` to restart the search service.

## Search Usage Analytics: Reporting API write failure
<a name="APIWrite"> </a>

 **Alert Name:** Search Usage Analytics: Reporting API write failure 
  
 **Summary:** Background or symptoms: 
  
1. The information written to the reporting API or database is used if the cache files must be rebuilt. When usage analytics cannot write to the reporting API, this means that the recommendations and data is not updated. Counts presented to the user are therefore out of date, and old or wrong data will also be presented next time that the cache is rebuilt. 
    
2. The Reporting API could not be read so that no cache files could be created and the analysis will therefore not be run. Running the analysis in this state would in effect overwrite the current data.
    
Impact:
  
- There will be no usage analytics analysis run.
    
- Recommendations will not be updated for items in the system.
    
### Cause

One or more of the following might be the cause:
  
- Reporting API is returning an error saying database is down.
    
- Reporting API is responding that the wrong data is being sent (nothing is stored).
    
- The reporting API cannot be reached (networking issues).
    
- Reporting API is returning an error saying database is down
    
- Reporting API is returning empty (wrong data).
    
- The cache dumper is malfunctioning.
    
### Resolution

1. Verify that there are no database problems in the system, and make sure that the analytics reporting database is functioning.
    
2. Verify that analytics processing component is functioning. This means that analyses can run.
    
3. Check for any networking issues.
    
## Search Usage Analytics: Store not available
<a name="Store"> </a>

 **Alert Name:** Search Usage Analytics: Store not available 
  
 **Summary:** Background or symptoms: 
  
1. Usage analytics cannot communicate with the event store. The usage analysis will not be started, and usage analytics data in the analytics reporting database and the search index will be stale. 
    
2. During the first step of the usage, the system fetches the event data from the event store. This is the raw input to the analysis. It contains the actions for the users in the system. Without this data, the analysis cannot be run.
    
### Cause

One or more of the following might be the cause:
  
- Network outage, Event Store process is down, or the event store is returning errors in response to request. 
    
- The event store can be down. The event store is returning no data because the components registering events are not functioning correctly, or there are networking issues so that the event store cannot be reached.
    
### Resolution

- Ensure that the event store is up and running.
    
- Verify that the event store is functioning correctly.
    
- Check for networking errors.
    
- Make sure the databases in the system are running.
