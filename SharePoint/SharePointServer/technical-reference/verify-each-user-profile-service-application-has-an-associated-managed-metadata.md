 **Rule Name:** Verify each User Profile Service Application has an associated Managed Metadata Service Connection. 
  
 **Summary:** If the Managed Metadata service is not associated with the User Profile service application, features such as social tagging and properties backed by managed terms do not work. 
  
 **Cause:** The Managed Metadata service connection is not included in the group of connections that is associated with the User Profile service application. 
  
 **Resolution: Edit the connections for the User Profile service application.**
  
1. Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Farm Administrators group.
    
2. On the Central Administration home page, click **Application Management**.
    
3. On the Application Management page, in the **Service Applications** section, click **Configure service application associations**.
    
4. On the Service Application Associations page, in the **View** list, click **Service Applications**.
    
5. In the **Web Application/Service Application** column, click the User Profile service application for which you want to edit the connection. 
    
6. In the **Configure Service Application Associations** dialog, select the **Managed Metadata Service** check box, or select **Default** in the **Edit the following group of connections** list, and then click **OK**. By default, all connections are included.
