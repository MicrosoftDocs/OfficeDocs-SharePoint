# Review supported editions and products for upgrading to SharePoint 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
When you plan an upgrade process, make sure that you verify that the intended upgrade path is supported. This article describes the editions and products that are supported and unsupported to upgrade to SharePoint Server 2016. 
  
Be aware that in-place upgrade is not supported for upgrades to SharePoint 2013. This includes upgrades across editions, such as from SharePoint Foundation 2013 to SharePoint Server 2016. For more information, see [What's new in SharePoint 2013 upgrade](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-server-2010/ee617150(v=office.14)).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upgrade from a pre-release version of SharePoint 2013 to the release version of SharePoint 2013 is not supported. > Pre-release versions are intended for testing only and should not be used in production environments. Upgrading from one pre-release version to another is also not supported. 
  
## Supported topologies
<a name="topologies"> </a>

For SharePoint 2013, the only upgrade method is the database-attach upgrade method. Because this method upgrades the databases instead of installing in place over an existing environment, you can attach the databases from a stand-alone installation to server farm (Complete) installation if you want to expand your environment. 
  
**Figure: Upgrade to either stand-alone or server farm (Complete) topologies**

Before you create your new SharePoint 2013 environment and attach and upgrade the databases, determine the type and size of the environment that you need.
  
### Physical topology guidance
<a name="section6"> </a>

The SQL Server topology — in addition to network, physical storage, and caching considerations — can significantly affect system performance. To learn more about how to map your solution design to the farm size and hardware that will support your business goals, see [Performance planning in SharePoint Server 2013](../administration/performance-planning-in-sharepoint-server-2013.md). For more information about requirements, see [Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint 2013](../install/hardware-software-requirements-2013.md).
