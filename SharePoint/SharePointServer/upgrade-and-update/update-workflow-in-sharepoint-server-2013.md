# Update Workflow in SharePoint Server 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)]
  
## Run cmdlets after software updates are installed

It is important that any Cumulative Updates (CU) for SharePoint Server 2013 and Workflow Manager are installed in a coordinated fashion. After an update has been performed, several Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets must be run in order to maintain the connection between the SharePoint Server 2013 farm and the Workflow Manager farm.
  
Run the following PowerShell cmdlets as an administrator from the SharePoint Management Shell after the updates have been installed for SharePoint Server 2013, Workflow Manager, and Workflow Manager Client.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest update level must be installed on SharePoint Server 2013, Workflow Manager, and Workflow Manager Client before you run the update cmdlets. 
  
```
$credential = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
$site = Get-SPSite(<siteUri>)
$proxy = Get-SPWorkflowServiceApplicationProxy
$svcAddress = $proxy.GetWorkflowServiceAddress($site)
Copy-SPActivitiesToWorkflowService -WorkflowServiceAddress $svcAddress -Credential $credential -Force $true

```

> [!NOTE]
> Because workflow supports environments with multiple Site Subscriptions, the  `$site` Site Collection address determines the proper configuration location for workflow settings. 
  
## Troubleshooting steps for workflow updates

- Make sure all components are on the latest patch level. This includes SharePoint Server 2013, Workflow Manager, and Workflow Manager Client.
    
- Verify the $proxy connection settings using the following commands:
    
  ```
  $proxy = Get-SPWorkflowServiceApplicationProxy
  $site = Get-SPSite(<siteUri>)
  $proxy.GetWorkflowServiceAddress($site)
  ```

- Inspect any errors displayed in the SharePoint Designer user interface or any errors shown in the SharePoint Workflow Status user interface.
