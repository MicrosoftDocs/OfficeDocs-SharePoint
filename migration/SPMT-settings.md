# SharePoint Migration Tool Settings

The following table details the settings available in SPMT.  Advanced settings should only be changed or managed by your IT professional. 


## General
 
|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Only perform scanning|If you wish to scan the files as a pre-assessment to migration, set to **On**.|
|Start migration automatically if no scan issue found |If set to **On**, migration will start automatically if no scan issues are found. |
|Preserve SharePoint permissions|If set to **On**, permissions on your source SharePoint files, folders, and items will be migrated. |
|Preserve permissions inheritance|Preserve permissions inheritance.|
|Preserve file share permissions.|Preserve permissions on the files migrated.|


## Users

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Azure Active Directory lookup |By default, this is set to **On**. If no user mapping file is provided by the user, then Azure Active Directory is used as the default for user mapping.|
|Automatic user mapping|User mapping will be done automatically.|
|User mapping file|By default,  *Azure AD lookup*  is used to map users when submitting migration jobs. If you want to use your own mapping file, select the file to be used by selecting **Choose file**. If you choose to use a custom user mapping file and want to preserve user permissions, turn off  *Azure Active Directory lookup*. By doing so, if a user isn't found in the mapping file, the tool won't look it up in Azure AD.|


## Filters

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Migrate file version history |If set to **Off**, only the most recent version of the file will be migrated. If set to **On**, you can choose whether to keep all versions, or limit it to a specific number.|
|Keep all versions|If set to **On**, all versions of a file will be migrated.|
|Number of versions to migrate|Enter a number to limit the number of file versions migrated.|
|Include hidden files|If set to **Off**, hidden system files will **not** be migrated. |
|Migrate files created after|Only migrate files created after the selected date. This setting may be used to limit the number of files migrated or to adhere to overall company governance policy regarding file retention.|
|Migrate files modified after|Only migrate files modified after the selected date. This setting may be used to limit the number of files migrated or to adhere to overall company governance policy regarding file retention. |
|Do not migrate files with these extensions|Enter a list of file extensions of file types you do not want to migrate. Separate each extension entered with a colon. Do not include the dot.  For example, **.txt** is entered as **txt**. </br> **Note** For files with multiple file extensions, for example *.ext1.ext2, add only the last extension, *.ext2*, to the exclusion list.|
|Migrate OneNote folder as OneNote notebook <br/>|By default, this is set to **Off**. When set to **Off**, OneNote folders will migrate over as a regular folder with files, and not as a OneNote Notebook.  If set to **On**, they will migrate as OneNote Notebooks.  At this time, the ability to migrate notebooks on SharePoint on-premises is disabled.  **NOTE** *This setting has been deprecated starting in Version 3.4.121.2.*  <br/>|
|Replace invalid filename characters|If set to **On**, any invalid character found in a filename will be replaced with the single valid character you have provided in the box. Invalid characters include *"<>:/\'. For a complete list, see: [Invalid file names and file types in OneDrive and SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa). </br></br>If set to **Off**, the tool will skip files whose name includes invalid characters. While having this set to off can improve performance when the source potentially contains a high number of files containing invalid characters, it also has drawbacks. To prevent malicious activities, source packages that generate more than 100 errors to the destination server will be blocked. As a result, all valid files in that package would also be blocked.  <br/> |
|Filter subsites|Enter any subsite names you want to exclude from migration.|
|Filter lists and libraries|Enter the names of the lists and libraries you want to exclude from migration.|
|Filter content type|Enter the content types you want to exclude from migration, separated by a semicolon (;), for example, Document;My Document.|


## SharePoint

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Migrate site settings|This setting is available only when the source selected is *all lists, libraries, pages, and web parts*. Four options are available:</br> **Preserve all settings**:  Migrate all site level settings supported, including title, logo, features, audit settings, and others. </br> **Skip title and logo:**  Title and logo are skipped, but all other site settings will be migrated.</br>  **Only title and logo:**  Only the title and logo will migrate. </br> **Skip all settings:**  No site level settings will be migrated.|
|Skip list with audience targeting enabled|Choose if you want to migrate SharePoint Server lists with audience targeted enabled. |
|Migrate all site fields and content types|Choose if you want to migrate sites fields even if they aren't required for migration.|
|Migrate managed metadata|Choose if you want to migrate all managed metadata terms that are in use on the site.|
|Migration of web parts and pages|Choose how to handle migration if the pages and web parts already exist in the destination.</br> Select one: *Overwrite duplicate*, *Rename duplicate*, *Skip duplicate*, or *Do not migrate*.|
|Temporarily allow migration of scripts|This setting will automatically allow the migration of scripted web parts.|
|Migrate site navigation|Migrate the navigation links of a site or page in SharePoint.|
|Migrate lists with lookup columns|This setting controls the behavior of migrating all lists referenced in lookup columns.  Options include:  *Migrate all lists referenced in lookup columns*, *Ignore lookup columns in migrated lists*, and *Only report error for any list with a lookup column. Do not migrate.*   This setting is only available if the source selected in a task is a list.  If you are doing a site migration, SPMT will automatically migrate all referred lists, so this setting will not appear to the user.


## Workflow migration


|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Power Automate flow owner|The user name who will be the default owner of the Power Automate flow.|


## Advanced

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Migration auto rerun|Choose if you want to automatically rerun a migration task to look for changes or additions. Select either *Run once*, or *Run up to 5 successive times*.|
|SharePoint Migration Tool working folder  <br/> |Choose if you want to create your own working folder.  By default, a temp folder will be created. <br/> **Note:** By default, the working folder is `%appdata%\Microsoft\MigrationTool`. Make sure that your working folder has a minimum of 150 GB of free space. It may need more depending on the size of the data you plan to migrate.|

## Custom Azure Storage

>[!Important]
>**Cost:**</br>
>If you choose to use your Azure Storage, be aware that you could incur bandwidth charges. Those will be billed depending on your Azure offer type and migration size. For general prices, see [Bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/).


|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Use custom Azure Storage|If you wish to use your own Azure Storage, set this value to **On**. Enter your account and key. Select if you want to enable encryption, and if you want temporary working files to be deleted when migration is complete.|

>[!Note] 
>This feature is supported only for *General Purpose storage accounts* as General Purpose accounts support Azure blobs and queues. This feature is not available for Blob Storage accounts.
