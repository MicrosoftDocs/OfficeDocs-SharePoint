# Overview of the SharePoint Migration Tool

The SharePoint Migration Tool lets you migrate content from SharePoint Server 2013 or from on-premises file shares and easily move them to either SharePoint or OneDrive in Office 365. 
  
Designed to be used for migrations ranging from the smallest set of files to a large scale enterprise migration, the SharePoint Migration Tool will let you bring your information to the cloud and take advantage of the latest collaboration, intelligence, and security solutions with Office 365.

## Planning and assessment

Planning is the key to a successful data migration.  The SharePoint Migration Assessment Tool (SMAT) is a simple command line executable that will scan the contents of your SharePoint Server 2013 farm to help identify any issues with data you plan to migrate to SharePoint Online. The results report points you to articles to help you fix any issues that were discovered. The tool runs in the background without impacting your production environment.
