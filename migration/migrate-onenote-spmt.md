# How the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) migrates OneNote folders

The SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) supports migrating your OneNote folders to Microsoft 365.  
But before migrating your OneNote folders, it's important to understand a little about their file structure.  

On your computer, a OneNote Notebook is presented as a normal folder. For each Notebook, there's a *.onetoc2* file created under the root folder of the Notebook folder. You can have as many Notebooks as you want.

If you create section groups in your Notebook, those groups are also presented as a folder. Under each section group, you can create multiple sections, and each one of those sections will be presented as *.one* file in file system. 

You can create multiple pages within a section, but the content of those pages will be contained in the same *.one* file as the section to which they belong.

When you open the OneNote application, they appear like this:

Folders are migrated to SharePoint as **OneNote Notebook** content rather than a normal folder with files. They'll appear in SharePoint like this:

For this **OneNote Notebook** to appear in your Notebooks list in OneNote, select the **Show Actions** ellipses next to the notebook name in the Document library, then select **Open > Open in app**. Remember to first close the OneNote application for the already migrated notebooks.
