# Migrate your content to Microsoft 365

Moving to Microsoft 365? Let us help you migrate your content easily and securely.

## Mover retirement

Mover admin migration functionality has now been fully integrated into Migration Manager. Mover is in the process of being retired.  For the full details see: [Mover retirement timeline](mover-retirement-timeline.md).

>[!Note]
>Attention businesses or those with EDU plans: We have retired the legacy [Mover](https://app.mover.io) tool's ability for admin-led migrations from [Google Drive](mm-google-overview.md), [Dropbox](mm-dropbox-overview.md), [Box](mm-box-overview.md), and [Egnyte](mm-egnyte-overview.md). Please use [Migration Manager](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM), located in the SharePoint admin center.

>All FastTrack-led migrations will transition to Migration Manager except those with multi-parent folders who have reached velocity migrations. These exceptions will need to finish their migrations by December 31, 2022.

We recommend that you move your classic SharePoint Server workflows to Power Automate flows.

- **Azure Data Box**. Want to remove the dependency on your WAN link to transfer data?  The Microsoft Azure Data Box is a service that lets you order a device from the Microsoft Azure portal. You can then copy TBs of data from your servers to the device, ship it back to Microsoft, and your data is copied into Azure. Once your data is in Azure, use SPMT to migrate content to SharePoint. To learn more, see [Migrate using the Azure Data Box](how-to-migrate-file-share-content-to-SPO-using-AzureDataBox.md).</br>

- **OneDrive sync app**  To migrate users' Windows known folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, and Camera Roll) to OneDrive, you can use [Known Folder Move](/onedrive/redirect-known-folders). If users want to move other files from their local computer or a network file share to OneDrive or SharePoint, it's often easiest for them to use the OneDrive sync app. Users drag their files or folders to a folder they're syncing.
