# Migration Assessment Scan: Apps

Learn how to mitigate issues with SharePoint add-ins during migration.
  
## Overview

Migrating SharePoint add-ins (formerly called apps) isn't supported in the target environment. The site content will be migrated, but the add-ins will not. As a result, once the site is migrated, the add-ins will need to be reinstalled. If you purchased the add-in, you will need to reclaim the license from the Add-in store.
  
## Data Migration

Site content will be migrated, but add-ins will need to be installed on the destination environment. If any add-ins stored data in the SharePoint App-web, that data will be orphaned and the add-in will be reinstalled cleanly.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Read through the provided report.
  
## Post Migration

Site owners will need to reinstall the add-in during the user acceptance testing (UAT) process. If there was an add-in that was purchased, the user who purchased the add-in will need to recover the license.
  
## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **Apps-detail.csv** report. 
  
This scan report provides a list of all the add-ins installed in the environment.
