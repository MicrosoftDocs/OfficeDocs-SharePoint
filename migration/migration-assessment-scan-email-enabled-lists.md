# Migration Assessment Scan: Email Enabled Lists

Learn how to mitigate issues with Email Enabled Lists during migration.
  
## Overview

On the source environment it is possible to configure lists that can accept incoming email. This feature is not available on the target environment.
  
## Data Migration

The contents in the libraries listed in the report will migrate, but new emails sent to the library will no longer automatically show up as the library will no longer accept incoming emails.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections, see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Communicate with end users that email will no longer show up in the target environment.
  
## Post Migration

Communicate with end users that email will no longer show up in the target environment.
