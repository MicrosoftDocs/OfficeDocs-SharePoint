# Migration Assessment Scan: External List

## Overview

External lists are those lists that were created from a Business Catalogs Services [BCS] application. These are lists that appear to be SharePoint Lists, but are actually backed by an external datasource. For example, you could have a list that is showing data from an external SQL Server or Web Service.
  
## Data Migration

BCS applications are not migrated to the target environment. As a result, External Lists are not migrated.
  
See [Migration Assessment Scan: BCS](migration-assessment-scan-bcs.md) for more information about BCS. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Build out a plan for the external lists. It is possible to configure Hybrid BCS to access on-premises data from SharePoint in Microsoft 365, but this will require some planning. 
  
See [Migration Assessment Scan: BCS](migration-assessment-scan-bcs.md) for more information about BCS 
  
## Post Migration

Ensure that your solutions, which rely on the BCS applications, function with the newly deployed BCS applications.
