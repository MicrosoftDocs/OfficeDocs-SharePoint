# Migration Assessment Scan: File Versions

Learn how to fix issues with file versions during migration.
  
## Overview

Versions have historically impacted the length of a migration for a given site in a linear fashion. The more versions you have, the longer it will take to migrate a given site.
  
## Data Migration

By default, versioning is enabled for all lists and libraries on the target platform. In the destination SharePoint site, there is no limit when versioning is enabled.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Examine the report and determine if preserving versions is needed or not for your business.
  
## Post Migration

Site owners should validate their version information was migrated as expected.
  
## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **FileVersions-detail.csv** report. 
  
This scan report provides a list of all the files in the environment that have versions.
