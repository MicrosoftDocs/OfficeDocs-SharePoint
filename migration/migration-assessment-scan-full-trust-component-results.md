# Migration assessment scan: Full trust component results

## Overview

The full trust solution scans check your SharePoint environment for references to code that was deployed via farm level solution packages [WSP] files. SharePoint in Microsoft 365 doesn't support full trust solutions and as a result it is necessary to understand where you're using this type of functionality and come up with a plan for migration to SharePoint.
  
## Migrate data

Content is migrated to SharePoint, however functionality tied to full trust code won't function post migration. You may see failures when using some of the content that relies on the full trust code that is no longer available post migration.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.
  
## Prepare for migration

Determine the various reasons full trust code was used in your on-premises environment. Build out a plan to replace the key business scenarios with SharePoint functionality. It may be necessary to build customizations or use add-ins to cover all scenarios.

If you find there isn't an equivalent solution provided in SharePoint in Microsoft 365, you may want to look into customizing SharePoint by following the [Microsoft 365 patterns and practices documentation](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/office-365-development-patterns-and-practices-solution-guidance).
  
## Post-migration

Once the content migration is complete, implement the plan that was built during "Preparing for Migration". This could involve deploying customizations, add-ins, or enabling functionality on the sites via the SharePoint interface.
  
## Detailed output

> [!NOTE]
> Input files are located under \<RootOutputFolder\>\Internal\FullTrustSolution. The input files are generated by reading all the installed farm level full trust solution packages and building a report of what is installed in the SharePoint farm. The input files location includes all the extracted full trust code package files as well as the files used to generate the report files described below.
  
In the July 2017 update, the full trust components are split into two separate scanners.
  
- FullTrustSolution_Farm scans for farm level usage of full trust code.

- FullTrustSolution_Content scans for full trust code references in your content.

The outputs for full trust solution scans are now focused on reporting areas of your environment that are using functionality provided by farm level WSP files deployed to your farm. If there are orphaned full trust solution references in your content, this tool won't report that information. You could use the [Test-SPContentDatabase](/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/Test-SPContentDatabase) PowerShell cmdlet that ships with SharePoint to look for those if they are of concern for your migration.

It's important to understand both levels [Farm and Content] of full trust code to build a comprehensive plan to avoid disruptions to your business or delays in your migration project.
  
FullTrustSolution_Farm generates the following reports:
