# Migration Assessment Scan: Large Excel Files

Learn how to mitigate issues with large Excel files during migration.
  
## Overview

The maximum limit for opening XLSX files in the browser is 10MB in the target environment. This setting is configurable in the source environment which may result in a change in behavior for your users. If you attempt to open a file larger than 10MB from a SharePoint site, it will prompt you to open the file in the Excel client application.
  
## Data Migration

XLSX files will be migrated.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Notify users of the expected behavior.
  
## Post Migration

Attempting to open an XLSX file larger than 10MB will prompt you to open the file in the Excel client. You will be prompted with a dialog.
