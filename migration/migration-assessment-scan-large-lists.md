# Migration Assessment Scan: Large Lists

Learn how to mitigate issues with Large Lists during migration.
  
## Overview

Lists over 20,000 items have historically caused issues with the migration tooling, making the ability to predict the time it takes to migrate sites that contain a larger list to be problematic.
  
## Data Migration

List data is migrated. However, the larger the list the more unpredictable the migration process has proven. Extremely large lists can result in an extended migration.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Investigate the large lists and determine the need for this content to be migrated to the target environment.
  
## Post Migration

The migration tooling has built-in validation to ensure all the list items are migrated. You will want to validate the large lists migrated as expected.
