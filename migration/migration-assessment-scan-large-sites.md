# Migration Assessment Scan: Large Sites

Learn how to mitigate issues with Large sites during migration.
  
## Overview

This assessment lets site owners validate site size and makes them aware of larger sites that might take a longer period of time to migrate.
  
## Data Migration

It is more difficult to predict a migration schedule and delivery of the migration for sites over 500GB.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Not applicable.
  
## Post Migration

Not applicable.
