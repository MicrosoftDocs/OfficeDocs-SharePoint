# Migration Assessment Scan: Managed Metadata Columns

## Overview

In SharePoint, it is possible to add a Managed Metadata column to a list and populate the list field with values from the Managed Metadata Service Application. Migration of these columns requires coordination with migration of the Managed Metadata Service Application data.
  
## Data Migration

Managed metadata columns are typically migrated, but support will depend on the migration tooling you select.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Before you start a migration project, you want to understand how many lists leverage Managed Metadata and you will want to try to migrate these as close to the time you migrate your Managed Metadata Service Application data to the cloud.
  
## Post Migration

If migrating managed metadata columns is supported in the migration tooling you have chosen, you will want to ensure that the lists using the columns migrated and is properly configured to create and edit list items.
  
## Scan Result Reports
