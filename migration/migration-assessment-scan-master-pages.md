# Migration Assessment Scan: Master Pages

Learn how to mitigate issues with Master pages during migration.
  
## Overview

During migration, the default master page should be set on all sites that are migrated. Doing this ensures that the site will render once the migration is complete as the content migration will not have a dependency on any custom master pages. If you have custom master pages assigned to sites, you will need to set the Master Page property on the new site after the migration has completed.
  
## Data Migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom master page files (\*.master) shouldn't be migrated to the new platform. The setting on the destination site will be set to the default master page. This process ensures the site will render after the migration. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Review the report and determine where you can move away from custom master pages before you migrate. Plan and understand what post migration work will be necessary to use the customized file moving forward.
  
## Post Migration

If you decide to continue using the customized master page on the new platform, you will need to apply the master page setting and validate your customizations work on the new platform.
