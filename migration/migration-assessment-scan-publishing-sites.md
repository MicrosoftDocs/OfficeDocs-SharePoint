# Migration Assessment Scan: Publishing Sites

## Overview

Publishing sites are typically customized intranet sites that rely on page layouts to allow end users to quickly create articles that are published to end users. Due to the high level of customizations that are involved with publishing sites, they may be difficult to migrate to SharePoint in Microsoft 365 without much remediation.
  
## Data Migration

The content in the publishing site may migrate, but any customization typically requires an extensive amount of remediation effort.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Test migration of the sites with the publishing features enabled. Understand what will need to be corrected post migration.
  
## Post Migration

Apply the fixes to your customized content post migration.
