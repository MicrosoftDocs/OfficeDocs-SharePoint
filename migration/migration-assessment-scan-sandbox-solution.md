# Migration Assessment Scan: Sandbox Solution

Learn how to mitigate issues with sandbox solutions during migration.
  
## Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SharePoint in Microsoft 365 does not support sandbox solutions. 
  
SharePoint does not support sandbox solutions. As a result, any functionality that is using the sandbox in your current environment will need to be replaced with a supported technology. See the Office Dev Center Patterns and Practices site for information on building customizations.
  
https://dev.office.com/patterns-and-practices
  
## Data Migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.
