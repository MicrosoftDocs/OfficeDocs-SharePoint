# Migration Assessment Scan: Site Notebook

## Overview

SharePoint 2013 and later support a feature called Site Notebook. This SharePoint feature is activated on the site and will generate a OneNote in the Site Assets library of the web. The file will be named with the title of the site.
Depending on the migration tools being used, your Site Notebook will migrate. However, the name of the Site Notebook in SharePoint in Microsoft 365 is different from the name of the file in the on-premises environment. As a result, links referencing the original file name will be broken. This report will provide a list of OneNote files that match the following scenario:
	• OneNote Notebook files
	• Exist in the Site Assets library
	• Have a name that ends in Notebook
	• OneNote is not empty
	• Is not flagged as deleted


  
## Data Migration

Depending on the migration tools being used, the Site Notebook will migrate but the file will have a different name resulting in broken links.

  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Prepare for questions about missing Site Notebooks and provide guidance to impacted users.
  
## Post Migration

Educate users on the change related to Site Notebooks.
