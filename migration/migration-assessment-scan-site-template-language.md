# Migration Assessment Scan: Site Template Language

## Overview

In SharePoint it is possible to install language packs and create sites leveraging multiple languages. During a migration, additional planning is required to validate sites that are not using a language familiar to the migration team.
  
## Data Migration

Site content will migrate, but validation of the content will require someone that speaks the language the content is in to confirm everything migrated correctly.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Plan to have appropriate resources available to perform user acceptance testing on the migrated content.
  
## Post Migration

Content experts will need to validate the migrated content.
  
## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the SiteTemplateLanguage-detail.csv report. This scan report provides a list of all the add-ins installed in the environment.
