# Migration Assessment Scan: Unsupported Site Templates

Learn how to fix issues with Unsupported Site Templates during migration.
  
## Overview

Every SharePoint site is based on a site template. In the SharePoint source environment, it was possible to create site collections using a variety of default templates as well as templates deployed via Full Trust Code (FTC). However, site collections that are supported for migration are the Team Site and Personal Site templates. The Personal Site Template is used for creating Microsoft OneDrive sites.
  
Supported Site Templates:
  
|**Template Friendly Name**|**Template**|**ID**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|TeamSite  <br/> |STS  <br/> |1  <br/> |
|Personal Site  <br/> |SPSPERS  <br/> |21  <br/> |
   
## Data Migration

Any site that is not using a Team Site or Personal Site template should be mapped to the Team Site template during migration. The content from the source environment is then copied into the new Team Site on the target.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint would be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Leverage the scan report for Unsupported Site Templates to identify site collections that are impacted. The impacted site's content will be copied into a Team Site template during migration, but it is possible the Team Site template does not include the features/functionality of the source site.
  
## Post Migration

Validate that your sites work post migration.
