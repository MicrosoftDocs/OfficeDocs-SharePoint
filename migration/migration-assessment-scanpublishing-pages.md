# Migration Assessment Scan: Publishing Pages

## Overview

Publishing sites are typically customized intranet sites that rely on page layouts to allow end users to quickly create articles that are published to end users. Due to the high level of customization that is involved with publishing sites, they may be difficult to migrate to SharePoint in Microsoft 365 without an extensive amount of remediation effort.
  
## Data Migration

The files can migrate however the pages may not function correctly on the new platform. The common causes are changes to SharePoint provided master pages, JavaScript, and CSS files.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Catalog the pages that use page layouts. Perform test migrations and plan for post migration remediation. You may find it's easier to start a new portal in SharePoint in Microsoft 365 and archive your on-premises portal once that site is up and running.
  
## Post Migration

Apply the fixes to your page layouts and publishing pages post migration.
