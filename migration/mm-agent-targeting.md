#  Agent groups in Migration Manager

With Migration Manager, you can create "agent groups" and assign agents to them.  Agent groups are considered an advanced feature and not commonly used by most users.

When an Agent is created in Migration Manager, it is not assigned to any group other than the default location. With the introduction of Agent Groups, you can assign one or more agents to a specific group. A group may represent a particular geographical location or other targeted purpose. Agent groups let you organize and prioritize your agents for a targeted purpose or regional goal.

|What|Why|
|:-----|:-----|
|Multi-geo| Organize your agents to be dedicated to specific geographic regions. | 
|Network scenarios|Create agent groups to optimize for network conditions |
|Prioritize migration jobs|Create agent groups so you can assign tasks according to groups by their priority |
|Assessment planning|Organize your tasks to run in a group that is used for isolating jobs that you just want to scan for early assessment.|

2. Under Agent group, select **Edit.**
3. Select **Add or remove agent groups**.
