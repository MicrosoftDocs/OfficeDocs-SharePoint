# Step 2: Scan and assess Box users

After you connect, Box users are automatically scanned. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.

A table summary appears at the top to give you an at-a-glance overview of your users. The summary includes content size, migration readiness, and any issues that need attention.

2. Select **Add source path** to manually search for more users, and then select how to do it.
