# Troubleshooting after your Box migration

Review these areas if you are experiencing issue with your Box migration.


## Automatic reruns

When a run ends, an automatic rerun may occur if the conditions listed under each scenario are met.

|Scenario|Conditions|
|:-----|:-----|
|The task is being scanned OR migrated for the first time|When a task is first scanned or migrated, it may trigger reruns. </br>When a task scan is started and then canceled. If that task is scanned again, it will NOT trigger reruns, because it was not the first time the task was scanned.|
|More automatic reruns are still available|A task will be automatically rerun a maximum of three times. </br>A first task scan/migrate action can result in triggering a total of four transactions: the original transaction (run), and three additional attempts (reruns). Six reruns can be triggered at the most: 3 for the initial scan, and 3 for the initial migration.|
|Last transaction status codes|An automatic rerun may occur if the last transaction ends with any of the following status codes: 201, 202, 210, 220, 211, 401, 403,404, 405, 406, or 491.|

## Canceling a transfer
A transfer can be canceled under the following conditions:
- The task is "Queued", and has a status code 600 or 601.
OR
- The task is "Running", and has a status code 620 or 300.



## Incremental feature

Our incrementals are delta operations that compare files in your source to files in Microsoft 365. Using this comparison, we copy anything that is new or has changed. This lets us keep Microsoft 365 data up to date when the final cut-over of users occurs. These incremental passes are an important part of our process.

**Technical clarification**: We compare what you have in your source to what is in Microsoft 365. We only transfer anything that doesn't already exist, or has a newer timestamp.

## 'Lost files'

During a transition where sharing paradigms change, there are many users who claim, “My files are lost!”

This assumption is common if they are not in clear communication about how the sharing structure changes when they sign in to Microsoft 365. A clear communication strategy helps users understand the changes.
