# Migration Manager: Reports and error codes for cloud migrations

Migration Manager generates a series of scan log and reports for cloud migration scenarios. Use these reports to help manage, audit, and troubleshoot your migration process.

>[!Note]
>These reports are for cloud migrations only. For file share migrations, learn more at: [Reports and errors for file share migrations](mm-reports.md)

## How to download 

**Scan log:** Select a scan task (each row in the Scans UI table represents a scan task) in the Scans UI, select “Download scan log” in the action bar. 

**Scan reports:** Select “Download reports” in the action bar directly in the Scans UI. Don't select any individual scan task. Scan reports are overall reports for all scan tasks. 

## Scan reports
