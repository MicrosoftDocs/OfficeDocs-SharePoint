# Step 2: Scan and assess Dropbox

After you connect to Dropbox, the accounts are displayed automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.

A table summary appears at the top to give you an at-a-glance overview of your users and content size.

2. To include other sources, select **Add source path**. Choose to look for new sources, enter a specific source, or bulk upload many sources via a CSV file.
