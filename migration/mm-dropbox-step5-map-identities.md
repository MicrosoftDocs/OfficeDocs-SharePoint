# Step 5: Map identities of Dropbox Drive to Microsoft 365 accounts

Map identities of your Dropbox to Microsoft 365 accounts while using Migration Manager.  

Identity Mapping is when you match the user and group identities that have access to your source environment (in this case Dropbox) and map those identities to Microsoft 365 user and group identities. This process is important to migration. If identities are not properly set up prior to migration, it can result in users losing access to content. It can also result in information being incorrect at the destination.

#### Migrating permissions from Dropbox to SharePoint

Permissions in Dropbox convert to the following in SharePoint:

|Dropbox|SharePoint|
|:-----|:-----|
|Can View|Read|
|Can Edit|Contributor|

#### Groups and mapped users

The migration admin can create a Microsoft 365 group or AD security group to map the group identities.

Mapped users and groups will not be added into *Site Visitors* or *Site Members*.  Permissions are granted to folders not sites.

#### Broken permissions

Migration Manager will migrate broken permission inheritance.

Authentication between Migration Manager and DropBox should be with Application Auth. If you received the error *Unable to access DropBox*, it's most likely not related to breaking permission inheritance in a subfolder. 

## Map identities

Map your groups and users in Dropbox to those in Microsoft 365 to migrate your Dropbox sharing settings.

1. Select the Migrations tab.
2. Select **Map identities** on the menu bar.
3.  Select **Auto-map** to have Migration Manager map the identities for you or select **Import users and groups** to upload the values using a CSV file.


### Mapping individual identities

1. To edit a single mapping, highlight the row. Enter the mapping Microsoft 365 user account. 
2. Select **Save**.

### Import users and groups

If you have many mappings to edit, you can choose to upload a CSV file containing your users and groups mappings. Download the  file template to your computer and enter your destinations. Save your file as a .csv file using any name you wish. 

Upload your own users and groups mappings using the M
1. Select **Import users and groups**.
2. Download the mapping.csv template file, inserting your own mappings. You can name the .csv any name you wish.
3. Choose **Select file**. Navigate to your mapping .csv file and select.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Select **Close**.


>[!Important]
>Make sure to verify your mappings before uploading the file.  The file will not be validated, and once migration cannot be changed.
