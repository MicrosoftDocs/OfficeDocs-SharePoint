# Step 2: Scan and assess Egnyte folders

After you connect to Egnyte, add the source paths to scan and assess your folders. 

1. Select **Add source paths** and choose a method; find new root folders, target a single source path, or bulk upload the source paths using a CSV file.

2. After adding the source, highlight any or all of the accounts and then select **Scan**, unless you've selected to automatically scan content.

>[!Important]
> The total number cannot exceed 50,000 tasks.

3. Once scan is complete, a table summary displays to give you an at-a-glance overview of your users. The summary includes content size, migration readiness, and any issues that need attention. 
4. Review the scanned users. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily.


## Download reports

Summary and detailed scan reports are available to assist you in troubleshooting. Download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.

1. Once the scan is complete, select **Download summary report**.
2. To download a detailed scan report for an individual folder, select a single row, then select **Download scan log**.   </br>
