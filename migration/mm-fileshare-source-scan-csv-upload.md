# Upload file share sources using a CSV file

Migration Manager lets you use a comma-separated (CSV) file to bulk upload your file share sources to scan. Use any text editor, or an application like Excel, to create the CSV file. Or download the blank CSV template from Migration Manager file share workflow.

- **Column heading**.  You can optionally use the column headings in your CSV file to make your file easier to read.
- **UTF-8**.  The encoding of the CSV file must be UTF-8.
