# Scan Google Sheet spreadsheets with Migration Manager

>[!Note]
>The "sheet scan" feature mentioned in this article is currently in **private preview** and not generally available.

A sheet scan is a scanning feature that exposes issues such as incompatible formulas and invalid embedded links in Google Sheets when exported and transferred to Microsoft Excel files. Migration Manager generates sheet reports listing issues discovered in the sheet scan process.
The sheet scan is turned off by default. Once you enable it in project settings, it's automatically run as part of the general scan process.

## Prerequisites

You must grant the **Microsoft 365 Migration** app access to all your Google Sheets spreadsheets in  Google Marketplace. Spreadsheet access must be granted before Migration Manager can run a **sheet scan** on your Google Sheets. 

### Grant access to Google Sheets

1. Sign in with your Google admin credentials to [Google Marketplace](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/gmail/marketplace/appdetails/888375727339).
2. Under **Drive**, verify that "See all your Google Sheets spreadsheets” status shows **Granted**.

3. If it hasn't been granted, select **Grant access** at the top of the page to grant access.
4. Once access has been granted, Migration Manager can run sheet scans for Google Sheets spreadsheet files.

## Enable Sheet scan

To enable a Google Sheet scan in a Google Drive migration project:

1. Select **Project Settings** in the top-right toolbar.
2. Select the **Advanced** tab.
3. Select **Enable Google Sheet scan** setting. Once enabled, the sheet scan is automatically included as part of the general scan.


## Sheet scan reports

Once a general scan is done, it may take a while for the Sheet Scan reports to be generated. 
To download Sheet Scan reports, select one or multiple scan tasks, and then select “Download reports – Sheet summary/Sheet detailed” from the action bar.
