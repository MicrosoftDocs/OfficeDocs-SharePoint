# Step 2: Scan and assess Google Drives

After you have connected to Google, the drives are displayed automatically for you. Once the scan is complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.

A table summary appears at the top to give you an at-a-glance overview of your users and content size.

2. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily.
