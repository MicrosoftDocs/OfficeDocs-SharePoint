# Step 3: Copy to Drive migrations tab for Google migration

After your Google Drives have been scanned, the drive status will show if it's error free and "Ready to migrate".  

1. From the **Drives** tab, select all Drives that have a status of "Ready to migrate". 
2. From the menu bar, select **Copy to Drive migrations**. You can also select one or multiple drives.
3. A panel appears to confirm your choices.  **Review your migration settings** and customize as needed.  The changes will be saved *after* the Drive has been copied.  
4. Select **Copy to Migrations**.
