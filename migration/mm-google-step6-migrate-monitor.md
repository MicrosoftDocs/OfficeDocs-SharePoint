# Step 6:  Migrate and monitor your Box migration (preview)

>[!Note]
> Features described in this topic are part of a public preview release. The content and the functionality may change and are not subject to the standard SLAs for support.
>
>This preview release currently supports the migration of up to approximately 1500 Box accounts in a single migration. For larger migrations, we recommend you use the [Mover migration tool](https://Mover.io).


Once have reviewed the accounts, confirmed the destinations, correctly mapped identities, you are ready to migrate.

1. Select the accounts to migrate.

3.  A confirmation step displays.  Click **Migrate**.  

>[!Note]
> Starting your migration only copies content from your Box account to the location you have specified in Microsoft 365.  Make sure the destinations are correct, as once the migration starts, they cannot be modified.

4.  Once the migration begins, monitor the migration status, and the table summary at the top.  Depending on how large your migration, this step may take hours or days.
