# Government cloud settings for Migration Manager 

If your tenant resides in a government cloud, you may have extra steps to perform before using Migration Manager.


- [Configuration values](#configuration-values)
- [GCC High and DoD customers](#gcc-high-and-dod-customers)
- [Endpoints for Government](#endpoints-for-government)


## Configuration values

Configuration values for government cloud tenants are listed in the following table. The default setting is **0**.

|Cloud|Setting value|
|:-----|:-----|
|Consumer|0|
|GCC|4|
|GCC High|2|
|DoD|3|


</br>


## GCC High and DoD customers

If you're either a **GCC high** or **DoD** customer, you need to make a change to your configuration file before you install the agent. All other cloud customers don't have to make this change as the default is already set to 0.

1. Download the agent setup file.
2. Open the setup file and remain on the **Welcome** page. 
3. Open *C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SPMigration\Bin\microsoft.sharepoint.migration.common.dll.config*.
4. Open *C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\SPMigrationAgentSetup\SPMigrationAgentSetup\microsoft.sharepoint.migration.common.dll.config*.
1. For GCCH, change the value of *SPOEnvironmentType* from 0 to 2, and for DoD, change the value of *SPOEnvironmentType* from 0 to 3.

5. On the Welcome page, select **Next**. Follow the prompts to enter your SharePoint admin username and password to your GCC High or DoD account.
6. Enter your Windows credentials that provides access to **all** the file shares that contain the content you want to migrate. Select **Install**.
7. Test agent access (optional) or select **Close**.
