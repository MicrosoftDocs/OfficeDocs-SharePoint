# Migration Manager reports

Migration Manager generates log files, summary and task level reports, and a performance report.  These will help you manage, audit and troubleshoot your migration process.

Summary report:

- [Summary Report](#summary-report)

Task level reports:

- [Item Summary](#item-summary)
- [Item Failure Report](#item-failure-report)
- [Item Report](#item-report)
- [Scan Summary](#scan-summary)
- [Structure Report](#structure-report)
- [Structure Failure Report](#structure-failure-report)
- [Structure Failure Summary](#structure-failure-summary)

Performance report

- [Performance Report](#performance-report)

## How to view the reports

These reports can be viewed while the migration is taking place or after the jobs are complete.

**Viewing task level reports:**

1. To see the report on a task, select the task name from the list. A panel will appear to the right.
2. Select **Download task report**. The report will download after the task is complete.

**Viewing summary reports:**

1. Select one or more completed tasks from the list. Click **Summary report**.
2. An aggregate summary report will be downloaded to your computer.

## Download detailed task level reports via Powershell

To download task level reports, run the following Powershell cmdlet.

1. [Download the powershell script](https://spmt.sharepointonline.com/download/ReportAggregator.zip) and extract the files.
2. **Run** *aggregatereports.ps1*.
3. Enter your tenant credentials.
4. From the Task Filter pane, select how you want to filter your reports:

   ![Screen to choose how to filter Migratino Manager reports](media/mm-reports-powershell-filter.png).

5. The aggregated report zip file will be found in the same folder as the PowerShell cmdlet.

## Summary Report

The summary report is an aggregate report that lists all successfully completed, failed, and in-progress tasks.

- **Aggregate Summary Report.csv.** This report contains a single row of data that gives the total picture; including total size, number of files migrated, duration.

When assessing your migration jobs, we recommend that you first look at these summary reports.

|Column|Description|
|---|---|
|Task name|Friendly name of the migration task|
|Status|Status of each task (success, failure, in progress, not started)|
|Source|File path or URL of the location of the data being migrated.|
|Destination|The URL of the Site and library to where the data will be migrated.|
|Total scanned items|Total number of files and list items, including those that will be filtered out because of settings or potential scan issues.|
|Total to be migrated items|The total number of files and list items that were expected to migrate excluding those filtered out based on settings or potential scan issues.|
|Migrated items|The total number of files migrated.|
|Items not migrated|Number of files that did not migrate.|
|Total bytes|Total number of bytes scanned in source destination.|
|Total GB|Total number of gigabytes scanned in source destination.|
|Migrated bytes|The total number of bytes of data migrated.|
|Migrated GB|The total size of the files migrated, expressed in gigabytes.|
|Agent|The address of the migration agent (VM or computer) that is running the migration task.|
|Duration|Length of time in minutes that the migration task took to complete.|
|TaskID|Unique ID of the task.|
|Task failure reason|Explanation of task failure.|
|Agent group|Name of agent group the task was assigned to.|

## Task Reports

When you need to do a more in-depth investigation or a thorough verification of your migration task, the task level reports help you drill down into the specific details.  We recommend using these reports to help you accomplish this.

- **ItemSummary.csv:** This is similar to the overall summary report except that it aggregates the data just for a single task.

- **ItemFailureReport.csv:** This is the failure report at the item level. This is a filtered version of the files report, showing only failures.

- **ItemReport.csv:**  A list of all the items this task attempted to do

- **ScanSummary.csv:** This report gives statistical totals.

- **StructureReport.csv:**  Structure report at the task level.

- **StructureFailureReport.csv:**  Structure failure report at the task level.

- **StructureFailureSummary.csv:**  This is an aggregate of all the structural task failure reports. This will only be generated if there are failures.

## Performance report

This report provides scores ranging from 1 to 100. The greater the number, the higher the speed. While these scores cannot predict how fast the migration will perform, they can help identify areas that could be impacting your migration performance.

|Reading source speed score|[Improving the speed at which the source can be read](./mm-performance.md#improving-the-speed-at-which-the-source-can-be-read)|
|Local disk performance score|[Improving the migration computer speed](./mm-performance.md#improving-the-migration-computer-speed)|
