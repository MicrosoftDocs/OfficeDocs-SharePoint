# Migration Manager: Reports and errors for file share migration

When an organization migrates their on-premises file shares to Microsoft 365, Migration Manager generates log files, summary and task-level reports, and a performance report. Use these reports to help manage, audit, and troubleshoot your migration process.

>[!Note]
>These reports are for file share migration only. For cloud migrations, learn more at: [Reports and errors for cloud migrations](mm-cloud-reports.md)

## How to view the reports

These reports can be viewed while the migration is taking place or after the jobs are complete.

**Viewing task level reports:**

1. To see the report on a task, select the task name from the list.
2. Select **Download task report**. The report will download after the task is complete.

**Viewing summary reports:**

1. Select one or more completed tasks from the list. Select **Summary report**.
2. An aggregate summary report is downloaded to your computer.

## Download detailed task level reports via PowerShell

To download task level reports, run the following PowerShell cmdlet.

1. [Download the PowerShell script](https://spmt.sharepointonline.com/download/ReportAggregator.zip) and extract the files.
2. **Run** *aggregatereports.ps1*.
3. Enter your tenant credentials.
4. From the Task Filter pane, select how you want to filter your reports:

   ![Screen to choose how to filter Migratino Manager reports](media/mm-reports-powershell-filter.png).

5. The aggregated report zip file is found in the same folder as the PowerShell cmdlet.

## Summary Report

The summary report is an aggregate report that lists all successfully completed, failed, and in-progress tasks.

- **Aggregate Summary Report.csv.** This report contains a single row of data that gives the total picture; including total size, number of files migrated, duration.

When assessing your migration jobs, we recommend that you first look at these summary reports.

|Column|Description|
|---|---|
|Task name|Friendly name of the migration task|
|Status|Status of each task (success, failure, in progress, not started)|
|Source|File path or URL of the location of the data being migrated.|
|Destination|The URL of the Site and library to where the data will be migrated.|
|Total scanned items|Total number of files and list items, including those that will be filtered out because of settings or potential scan issues.|
|Total to be migrated items|The total number of files and list items that were expected to migrate excluding those filtered out based on settings or potential scan issues.|
|Migrated items|The total number of files migrated.|
|Items not migrated|Number of files that didn't migrate.|
|Total bytes|Total number of bytes scanned in source destination.|
|Total GB|Total number of gigabytes scanned in source destination.|
|Migrated bytes|The total number of bytes of data migrated.|
|Migrated GB|The total size of the files migrated, expressed in gigabytes.|
|Agent|The address of the migration agent (VM or computer) that is running the migration task.|
|Duration|Length of time in minutes that the migration task took to complete.|
|TaskID|Unique ID of the task.|
|Task failure reason|Explanation of task failure.|
|Agent group|Name of agent group the task was assigned to.|

## Task Reports

When you need to do a more in-depth investigation or a thorough verification of your migration task, the task level reports help you drill down into the specific details.  We recommend using these reports to help you accomplish this.

- **ItemSummary.csv:** This is similar to the overall summary report except that it aggregates the data just for a single task.

- **ItemFailureReport.csv:** This is the failure report at the item level. This is a filtered version of the files report, showing only failures.

- **ItemReport.csv:**  A list of all the items this task attempted to do

- **ScanSummary.csv:** This report gives statistical totals.

- **StructureReport.csv:**  Structure report at the task level.

- **StructureFailureReport.csv:**  Structure failure report at the task level.

- **StructureFailureSummary.csv:**  This is an aggregate of all the structural task failure reports. This will only be generated if there are failures.
