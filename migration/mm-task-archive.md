# Archive Migration Manager tasks 

>[!Note]
> The ability to archive tasks will soon be retired. We recommend reviewing your archived migrations tasks and decide how you want to manage them going forward. Already archived tasks will not be deleted.


Migration Manager lets you archive migration tasks, letting you save them to be run at a future date, providing an additional way to filter and manage your tasks. Archived tasks can be reactivated at any time.

1. From the Migration tab, view your migration tasks.  Highlight the task you want to archive.
2. Select **Archive**.  The status column will change to "Archived" and can be filtered on.
