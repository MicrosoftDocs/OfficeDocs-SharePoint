## How do I delete my account?

Deleting your account deletes all your scheduled transfers, multi-user migrations, and authorized connectors.

To close your account, follow these steps.

1. Log in. To visit your **Account** settings (**shortcut**), in the top right corner of our app, select **account email**.
2. On the left hand side, select **Leave Mover**.
3. Read all of the text on that page.
4. If you are ready, enter your current password, and select **Delete Account**.
5. A prompt appears. Select **OK**.

To reiterate:

**Deleting your account:**

- Deletes all scheduled transfers.
- Deletes all connector authorizations.
- Deletes any subscriptions associated with your account.
- Deletes your Mover account.

**This does not:**

- Delete your transfer history. We retain these for security and compliance.
- Remove any trace that your account once existed with Mover.

>[!Important]
>Deleting your account is **not** reversible.

## How do I edit my email notifications?

By default, you receive an email every time a transfer is completed. To edit your email notification settings:

1. Log in. To visit the account settings, in the top right of our app, select your email address.
2. Select **Preferences**.
3. You have the option to receive emails **On Completion** (default), **Never**, or **Only on Errors**.

## Can I change my account email?

Unfortunately at this time, we do not allow you to change the email associated with your account.

You may, however, delete your account — losing the schedules, connector authorizations, and transfer history associated with it — and create a new account with the email you would prefer.

## How do I check my transfer usage?

Checking your usage of our app lets you know the total amount of gigabytes you have transfered over the history of your account.

To check your transfer data usage, follow these steps.

1. Log in. To visit your **Account** settings, in the top right corner of our app, select **account email**.
2. By default, you are already in the **Plan** section.
