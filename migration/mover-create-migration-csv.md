# Creating a new migration from a CSV (optional)

Sometimes you have thousands of users and a complicated directory schema that you want to import. In these cases, it's desirable to plan out your migration in a spreadsheet.

In these cases, we trust the CSV upload option is useful. This lets you lay out all your users and directories, and then provide that information to us in .csv format for us to create your migration.

## Users to migrate

Your CSV file must follow this format:

A heading for the source and destination, followed by the paths, and optional tags on each line.

`Source Path,Destination Path,Tags`</br>
`user1@example.com,user__1@corp.example.com,"Pilot, IT"`</br>
`user2@example.com,user__2@corp.example.com,"Pilot, Sales"`</br>
`user3@example.com/src dir,user3@example.com/migrated,"Pilot, IT"`</br>
`Source Shared Drive,user4@example.com/Team Folder,"Pilot, Sales"`</br>
`https://TENANT02.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteName/Shared%20Documents,user5@example.com,"Marketing, Sales"`</br>

>[!Note]
>Ensure your CSV has no spaces after each comma separated value. Values that require commas must be wrapped in quotation marks.

Sample CSV file format:

|Source Path|Destination Path|Tags|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|user01@domain<span><span>.com|user_01@domain.<span><span>com|
|Team Folder|user_02@domain.<span><span>com|
|Shared Drive|user_03@domain.<span><span>com|
|/C:/folder|user_04@domain.<span><span>com|
|user01@domain<span><span>.<span><span>com|https<span><span>://TENANT01.<span><span>sharepoint.<span><span>com/sites/SiteName/Shared%20Documents|
|https<span><span>://<span><span>TENANT01.sharepoint.<span><span>com/sites/SiteName/Shared%20Documents|https<span><span>://TENANT02.<span><span>sharepoint.<span><span>com/sites/SiteName/Shared%20Documents|

>[!Note]
>When URL mapping to SharePoint, you must remove everything after /Shared Documents; otherwise,the URL fails.

For example, this full URL won't work:
`https://TENANT01.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteName/Shared Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx`

Change it to:
`https://TENANT01.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteName/Shared Documents`

## Creating your CSV in Excel

To use an Excel spreadsheet to create your CSV:

1. Ensure you have two columns, one titled `Source Path`, and one `Destination Path`.

2. List the relative paths, domains, and usernames on the subsequent rows.

3. Export your spreadsheet as a CSV:

   1. Select **File**. 
   1. Select **Save As**.
   1. From the **File Format** options, select **CSV**.
