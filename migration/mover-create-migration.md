# Create a new migration

>[!Important]
>**Mover is now retired for all Admin led migrations**. The ability to migrate from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, and Egnyte has been fully integrated into Migration Manager. For full details see: [Mover retirement timeline](mover-retirement-timeline.md).  Migration Manager does not support the migration of Amazon S3 or Azure blob storage.
>
>All FastTrack-led migrations have transitioned to Migration Manager.
>
>**Tenant to tenant migration**. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. Learn more here: [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).  
>
>A cross tenant migration solution for SharePoint is currently being developed and in private preview.  To learn more, see [How to participate in the Cross-tenant SharePoint migration preview](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-sharepoint-migration).



Select **Continue Migration Setup**, and our app moves to the **Migration Manager**.

The next step creates a user list of those transferring.

From your newly created migration in the **Migration Manager**, there are two ways to add users:

- Select **Add Users**.

- Or, select **Migration Actions**, and then select **Add to Migration**.

Select one of two options:

1. Auto Discover Users.
  - Select **Automatically Discover and Add Users**, and our app automatically finds your users and attempts to match them up.

2. Upload Migration CSV File.
  - Either drag a file into the designated space, or select **Choose a file to upload**, and add a customized CSV file for your migration.

>You still get to finalize your migration before any data moves!
