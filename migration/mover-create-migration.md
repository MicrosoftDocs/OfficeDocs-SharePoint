# Create a new migration

Select **Continue Migration Setup**, and our app moves to the **Migration Manager**.

![Create migration](media/create-migration.png)

The next step creates a user list of those transferring.

From your newly created migration in the **Migration Manager**, there are two ways to add users:

- Select **Add Users**.

- Or, select **Migration Actions**, and then select **Add to Migration**.

Select one of two options:

1. Auto Discover Users.
  - Select **Automatically Discover and Add Users**, and our app automatically finds your users and attempts to match them up.

2. Upload Migration CSV File.
  - Either drag a file into the designated space, or select **Choose a file to upload**, and add a customized CSV file for your migration.
