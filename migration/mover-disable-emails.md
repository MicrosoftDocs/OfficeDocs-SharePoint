# Disable email notifications


One of the first activities you want to carry out before starting a migration is to turn off all email notifications.  This will ensure that your customers are not spammed with status emails regarding transfers, failures and progress.

**To turn off email notifications**

1. Log into the tool, and then click on the username in the top right-hand corner.
2. Select **Preferences** and check **Never**.
