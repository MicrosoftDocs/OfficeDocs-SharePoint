# Troubleshooting Mover migration errors


>[!Important]
>**Mover is now retired for all Admin led migrations**. The ability to migrate from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, and Egnyte has been fully integrated into Migration Manager. For full details see: [Mover retirement timeline](mover-retirement-timeline.md).  Migration Manager does not support the migration of Amazon S3 or Azure blob storage.
>
>All FastTrack-led migrations have transitioned to Migration Manager.
>
>**Tenant to tenant migration**. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. Learn more here: [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).  
>
>A cross tenant migration solution for SharePoint is currently being developed and in private preview.  To learn more, see [How to participate in the Cross-tenant SharePoint migration preview](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-sharepoint-migration).

## Other Mover errors

|Error|Action to take|
|:-----|:-----|
|Error: "Bad Request: Unable to update users. Required heading not found: ID"|The ID column of each user needs to be the first column of the .csv in order to change already existing User Transfer Rows. For more information, see: [Review users: editing](./mover-review-users.md)|

|Error: Unable to get contents of this folder: Connection Error|Some IT departments don't want to do Box or Dropbox data migration themselves, so instead of using Box or Dropbox (Co-Admin) to O365, they're asking all their users to use Single User to OneDrive For Business (Single User). <br>- If your organization requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) and you receive an authorization error, your conditional access policy may not be configured correctly.<br>- One workaround is for the administrator to disable MFA for these users during Mover migrations.<br>- Otherwise, you'll need to contact "Azure Identity" support for help with configuring conditional access policies.
