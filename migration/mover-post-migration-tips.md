# Post-migration tips

We are stewards of your data. Our approach in all things is to see you successfully cross the finish line. We provide full service support and are ready to solve any problem and communicate with you about any issue.

## Communication

Follow up with users after migration to ensure they know where to access their data.
Provide a link to set up their new Office 365 accounts. Be prepared to answer any questions or concerns, as it is common for users to complain about a new system.

## Example email

**Subject**: ATTENTION: Login to Office 365*

**Message**: 
Over the weekend, we migrated our team from Office 365 to our new Office 365.

All files and folders were transferred without any issues. To set up your new Office 365 account, follow this link.

Your username remains the same; however, you must create a new password.

From this point forward, log into your Office 365 account.

If you have any questions or concerns, let us know.
