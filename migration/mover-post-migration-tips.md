# Post-migration tips

>[!Important]
>**Mover is now retired for all Admin led migrations**. The ability to migrate from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, and Egnyte has been fully integrated into Migration Manager. For full details see: [Mover retirement timeline](mover-retirement-timeline.md).  Migration Manager does not support the migration of Amazon S3 or Azure blob storage.
>
>All FastTrack-led migrations have transitioned to Migration Manager.
>
>**Tenant to tenant migration**. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. Learn more here: [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).  
>
>A cross tenant migration solution for SharePoint is currently being developed and in private preview.  To learn more, see [How to participate in the Cross-tenant SharePoint migration preview](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-sharepoint-migration).



We are stewards of your data. Our approach in all things is to see you successfully cross the finish line. We provide full service support and are ready to solve any problem and communicate with you about any issue.

## Communication

Follow up with users after migration to ensure they know where to access their data.
Provide a link to set up their new Office 365 accounts. Be prepared to answer any questions or concerns, as it is common for users to complain about a new system.

## Example email

**Subject**: ATTENTION: Login to Office 365*

**Message**: 
Over the weekend, we migrated our team from Office 365 to our new Office 365.

All files and folders were transferred without any issues. To set up your new Office 365 account, follow this link.

Your username remains the same; however, you must create a new password.

From this point forward, log into your Office 365 account.

If you have any questions or concerns, let us know.
