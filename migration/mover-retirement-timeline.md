# Mover.io retirement timeline

>[!Note]
>Attention businesses or those with EDU plans: We have retired the legacy [Mover](https://app.mover.io) tool's ability for admin-led migrations from [Google Drive](mm-google-overview.md), [Dropbox](mm-dropbox-overview.md), [Box](mm-box-overview.md), and [Egnyte](mm-egnyte-overview.md). Please use [Migration Manager](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM), located in the SharePoint admin center.

>[**Individuals or students**: You may continue to use Mover, learn how!](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/move-your-school-files-when-you-graduate-7dbda93c-71e6-483f-8914-ad445554cd31)

>All FastTrack-led migrations will transition to Migration Manager except those with multi-parent folders who have reached velocity migrations. These exceptions will need to finish their migrations by December 31, 2022.

Mover's cloud migration scenarios are fully available in Migration Manager and have set the timeline to retire Mover. Unifying the migration experience within Migration Manager simplifies the tool decision for you and allows us to focus our development and support resources to help you meet your migration goals.

## FAQs

**Question:**  Why are we retiring Mover.io?</br>
**Answer:**    Mover's cloud migration functionality is now fully integrated into Migration Manager, Microsoft'ts recommended tool for file migrations. This simplifies the experience for you and helps us support you more effectively.

**Question:** Why are we starting the retirement now?</br>
**Answer:**   Until now, we have been integrating the Moverâ€™s cloud migration functionality into Migration Manager. Migration Manager now offers the full functionality of Mover along with an improved experience within the Microsoft admin center. 


**Question:**  Will my current Mover migrations stop working?</br>
**Answer:**    No. Microsoft is retiring the ability to create **new** connectors. Existing migrations will continue to operate on Mover until December 31, 2022.  See the timeline above. 

**Question:**  I'm migrating using Mover. If my existing connector gets disconnected, can I still reauthorize it to continue?</br>
**Answer:**    Yes. You can reauthorize an existing connector until December 31, 2022.

**Question:** Will individual or consumer migrations continue to work on Mover?</br>
**Answer:**   We'll continue to support individual, consumer, or student migrations from Mover for some time. Refer back to this page for updates on these migration scenarios. 

**Question:** Is tenant-to-tenant migration supported in Migration Manager?</br>
**Answer:**  No. Currently, Microsoft plans to offer a solution during 2023. The solution is expected to be a premium feature that's distinct from legacy Mover. In the interim, we recommend using a third-party solution for your Microsoft 365 tenant-to-tenant migration needs.
