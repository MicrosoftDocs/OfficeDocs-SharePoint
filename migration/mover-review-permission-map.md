# Reviewing your permission map

The permission map is a critical part of your migration.

When a user is migrated, we transfer files and folders and share any required data. We already know who is copying data, but we also need to know who might have content shared with them, even if they don't copy data.

To stay organized, we'll provide a secondary list of your users, called a permission map. This list includes everyone who could possibly receive sharing permissions to any files or folders that might be migrated. This even includes users who are not migrating data.

Another important consideration is that usernames and emails aren't always consistent across platforms, and the permission map helps us line up everyone.

**Example**: `jane@example.com` is actually `j.smith@example.com`

We automatically detect users and handle perfect matches. Any inconsistencies must be manually reconciled. The permission map can be continually updated, because with each incremental pass of the migration, permissions are reapplied.

1. To view your permission map, in the top right of the **Migration Manager**, select **Migration Actions**, and then, from the dropdown menu, select **Edit Permission Map**.

You may either auto-discover or upload a permission map file. We automatically pair perfect matches. If a user or group does not have a perfect match in Office 365, you can correct it in our interface.

2. Select **Auto-discover Users**.

3. At any time, you may view and edit your permission map.

    >[!Note]
    >A blank destination entry automatically cancels any permission sharing for that user or group.

    >[!Note]
    >Adding a new line for a specific users - for example, user01@gmail.com to user01@hotmail.com - that perfectly matches auto-discovered permissions by the domain - for example, @gmail.com to @hotmail.com - is automatically removed. Our app marks these as redundant entries.
