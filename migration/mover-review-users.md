# Mover migration: Reviewing your users

>[!Important]
>**Mover is now retired for all Admin led migrations**. The ability to migrate from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, and Egnyte has been fully integrated into Migration Manager. For full details see: [Mover retirement timeline](mover-retirement-timeline.md).  Migration Manager does not support the migration of Amazon S3 or Azure blob storage.
>
>All FastTrack-led migrations have transitioned to Migration Manager.
>
>**Tenant to tenant migration**. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. Learn more here: [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).  
>
>A cross tenant migration solution for SharePoint is currently being developed and in private preview.  To learn more, see [How to participate in the Cross-tenant SharePoint migration preview](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-sharepoint-migration).



## User caching

Once we have loaded your users, *do not* modify your users in any way. Our system caches usernames once the connector is loaded, and any modification of usernames in Microsoft 365 or your source system after you connect will cause failures. We cache these names for four days.

## Checking paths

Confirm that the users in the source match the users in the Office 365 destination. Usually the emails/usernames match up, but it depends how you structure and name your users. *Be diligent during this step!*

## Manually editing a source or destination

Be aware that Users can only be edited if they haven't been scanned, or had a transfer run.

To edit a user source entry:

1. To select a user row, on the left side of a row, select the respective checkbox.
2. On the right and directly above the user rows, find **User Actions**.
3. A new side panel opens, enabling you to edit the source path.
4. To select your parent source path, double-click it, and to complete your edit, select **Save**.

To edit a user destination entry:

1. To select a user row, on the left side of a row, select the respective checkbox.
2. On the right and directly above the user rows, find **User Actions**.
3. A new side panel opens, enabling you to edit the Office 365 destination path.
4. To select your parent destination path, double-click it. To complete your edit, select **Save**.

## Editing sources or destinations using a .csv file

You can also choose to edit your user entries via CSV, though this is a fairly in-depth process. *If you are simply looking to make a handful of edits to your paths, we recommend using the previous method.*

To edit or update your current existing user pairings:

1. Near the top right of the **Migration Manager**, select **Migration Actions**.
2. Select **Update Migration**.
3. Upload your .csv file.</br>

Tips for creating the CSV:
  - The CSV needs to follow this format:
     - `ID, Source Path, Destination Path`</br>
     - `id12345, /first.last@example.com, /f.last@example.com`

  - The `ID` column is required to specify the existing row in the **Migration Manager**, whereas the source and destination path are optional - as in, you don't need to enter both if you only want to edit the destination path, for example - and leaving both of those columns blank mean no changes are made.
 
      - To get the ID for each row:</br>
        a. Find and select **Migration Actions**.</br>
        b. Select **Customize Columns**, and select **ID**.</br>
        
        You'll now be able to see the ID appearing in each row. If you refresh the page, this info disappears unless you select **Save Column State**.

4. After you've created your CSV file using these instructions and format, you can drag and drop the file into our app, or select **Choose a file to upload**. Changes to your user pairings are implemented immediately.

## Adding

If you missed users in your original CSV upload, or simply want to add new user entries to the current migration, add them via CSV. All entries you add in this manner are appended to the current migration, meaning this won't modify existing rows, and it is possible to create duplicate entries alongside the ones that already exist.

To add new users:

1. Near the top right of the **Migration Manager**, select the **gear** icon.
2. Select **Add to Migration**.
3. Upload your .csv file.</br>

Tips for creating the CSV:
  - CSV needs to follow this format:</br>
    `Source Path, Destination Path`</br>
    `/first.last@example.com, /flast@example.com`
  - **CSV is created the same way you would if you initially created the migration with a CSV**.
4. After you've created your CSV file using these instructions and format, drag and drop the file into our app, or select **Choose a file to upload**. Changes to your user pairings are implemented immediately.

## Duplicating

At any time, you may duplicate a user in the **Migration Manager** list. To duplicate a user entry:

1. To choose a user row, on the left side of a row, select the respective checkbox. You may select more than one entry at a time.
2. On the right and directly above the user rows, find **User Actions**, or right-click the user row you want to duplicate.
3. In the context menu, select **Duplicate # User**.
4. Select **OK**.</br>

A new user entry appears. From here, you can change the directory, schedule, or even the entire user.

## Scheduling

You can set an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly schedule for each user, even after they have been run.

To create or edit a schedule:

1. Select the user pairing(s) you want to schedule.
2. Select the **User Actions** dropdown menu.
3. Select **Schedule # Users**.
4. Configure your Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly setup, including the timing and day of the week (where applicable).
5. Select **Apply Schedules to X Users**.
6. Click **Start migration x users**
7. Click **On schedule**.
8. Agree to **Terms and Conditions**.
9. Click **continue**.

## Deleting

Be aware that users can only be deleted if they haven't been scanned, or had a transfer run.

To delete a user entry:

1. To choose a user row, on the left side of a row, select the respective checkbox. You can select more than one entry at a time.
2. On the right and directly above the user rows, select **User Actions**, or right-click the user row you want to delete.
3. In the context menu, select **Delete User**.
>[!Important]
>This is permanent and cannot be undone unless you create a new entry.
