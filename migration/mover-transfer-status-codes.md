# Mover transfer status codes

>[!Important]
>**Mover is now retired for all Admin led migrations**. The ability to migrate from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, and Egnyte has been fully integrated into Migration Manager. For full details see: [Mover retirement timeline](mover-retirement-timeline.md).  Migration Manager does not support the migration of Amazon S3 or Azure blob storage.
>
>All FastTrack-led migrations have transitioned to Migration Manager.
>
>**Tenant to tenant migration**. Cross-tenant OneDrive migration is now available outside of Migration Manager. Learn more here: [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).  
>
>A cross tenant migration solution for SharePoint is currently being developed and in private preview.  To learn more, see [How to participate in the Cross-tenant SharePoint migration preview](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-sharepoint-migration).



## Automatic reruns

When a run ends, an automatic rerun may occur if the conditions listed under each scenario are met.

|Scenario|Conditions|
|:-----|:-----|
|The task is being scanned OR migrated for the first time|When a task is first scanned or migrated, it may trigger reruns. </br>When a task scan is started and then canceled. If that task is scanned again, it will NOT trigger reruns, because it wasn't the first time the task was scanned.|
|More automatic reruns are still available|A task will be automatically rerun a maximum of three times. </br>A first task scan/migrate action can result in triggering a total of four transactions: the original transaction (run), and three additional attempts (reruns). Six reruns can be triggered at the most: 3 for the initial scan, and 3 for the initial migration.|
|Last transaction status codes|An automatic rerun may occur if the last transaction ends with any of the following status codes: 201, 202, 210, 220, 211, 401, 403,404, 405, 406, or 491.|

## Canceling a transfer
A transfer can be canceled under the following conditions:
- The task is "Queued", and has a status code 600 or 601.
OR
- The task is "Running", and has a status code 620 or 300.
