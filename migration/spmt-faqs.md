# Frequently asked questions:  SharePoint Migration tool (SPMT)


**Question:** Can the SharePoint Migration tool (SPMT) migrate content from one SharePoint tenant to another SharePoint tenant?</br>
Answer:  No. SPMT can migrate content from SharePoint on-premises Server, but not from another SharePoint Online tenant. However, a cross-tenant migration solution for SharePoint and OneDrive is available. Learn more at [Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration).

**Question:** How can I use SPMT to migrate a large amount of data to Microsoft 365?</br>
Answer: First, you need to install SPMT on physically different Windows computers or virtual machines. Then create bulk migration jobs on each SPMT instance, and then run them in parallel to achieve the maximum migration throughput. If you want to reach high throughput by orchestrating migration jobs automatically, use Migration Manager. 

**Question:** Where are local SPMT logs stored?</br>
Answer: SPMT logs are stored here: *C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MigrationTool*

**Question:** Is SPMT available for Government clouds?</br>
Answer: Yes. Learn how to configure your settings: [Government cloud settings](spmt-settings.md#government-cloud-support)

**Question**: Can I migrate only Site Pages?
Answer: Yes, However, site pages can only be migrated by uploading a CSV or JSON file.

**Question**: What authentication methods does SPMT support connecting to SharePoint Online?
Answer: SPMT only supports username & password.

**JSON Example**

```javascript
{
  "Tasks": [
    {
      "SourcePath": http://source_path/sitename,
      "TargetPath": https://destination_path/sitename,
      "Items": {
        "Lists": [
          {
            "SourceList": "Site Pages",
            "TargetList": "Site Pages"
          }
        ],
        "SubSites": []
      },
      "MigrationType": "Content"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Question**: How can I preserve existing web parts on a destination site in site incremental migration?</br>
Answer: Under the setting "Migration of web parts and pages", select "Don’t migrate to skip webpart migration" in incremental migration. Learn more: **[SharePoint Migration Tool Settings](/sharepointmigration/spmt-settings#sharepoint)**.

**Question**: Why do I see deletion entries in the audit log by the system account after completing migration?</br>
Answer: This behavior is expected during migration. When you migrate files to SharePoint Online using the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT), the tool checks if the source files are newer than the destination files. If the source files are newer, the system account will delete the destination files and log the deletion in the audit log. Deletion entries in the audit log after migration are due to this behavior.

**Question**: which features does SPMT not support for SharePoint on-premises Server migrations?</br>
