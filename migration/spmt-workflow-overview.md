# Overview: Migrate SharePoint Server workflows to Power Automate

>[!Note]
>This feature is currently in public preview, and subject to change.

Workflows created with SharePoint Server  or SharePoint Server Designer can be migrated to Power Automate using the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT). 

## What is supported

Using the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT), you can now migrate:
- **SharePoint Server 2010 out-of-the-box (OOTB) workflows** to Power Automate including: Approval, Collect Feedback, Collect Signature, and Three-state workflows
- **SharePoint Server 2010 and 2013 Designer (SPD) workflows** to Power Automate
- List, library workflows and content-type workflows (not site workflows)
- Workflow definitions and associations (not workflow history data)

>[!Note]
>Microsoft removed **SharePoint Server 2010** workflow services from existing tenants on November 1, 2020. We recommend that you move your classic SharePoint Server workflows to Power Automate flows. 


## Steps

|Step|What happens|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Step 1: Configure endpoints and Power Automate](spmt-workflow-step1.md)|Configure required endpoints.  If your tenant has never used Power Automate, configure it before you begin migration.|
|[Step 2: Migrate workflows](spmt-workflow-step2.md)|Using SPMT, migrate your SharePoint Server workflows.|
|[Step 3: Activate workflows](spmt-workflow-step2.md)|Sign in to Power Automate to activate the newly migrated workflows.|


## Prerequisites

Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185075" target="_blank">Migration center</a> in the SharePoint admin center, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: The user account you use to migrate must be a global admin or OneDrive/SharePoint admin on the Microsoft 365 tenant, and be a Power Automate admin who can manage the solution. As this user account will be set as the owner of migrated flow, it must also be assigned the *Environment Maker* role. [Learn more about Environment Maker role](/power-platform/admin/database-security).
- **Access to the source**: Your SharePoint Server account credentials must have read access to any workflow you plan to migrate.
- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.


## General process

- **Scan workflow**
Workflow scans generate a report that lets you review your workflow inventory and plan the migration. Select “Only perform scanning” on the Choose your settings page to start a scan.
</br>

- **Migrate workflow**
Review your scan and determining you are ready to migrate your SharePoint Server workflows. Choose to either use SPMT to step you through the process or use the PowerShell method.
</br>

- **Re-run migration** 
SPMT will skip a workflow if it has already been successfully migrated. If you want to run a new migration to override the migrated flow, delete it from the destination before starting the migration.
