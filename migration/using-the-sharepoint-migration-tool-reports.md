# Step 4: Monitoring and reporting status of migration tasks

After you select **Migrate**, the progress of your migration task appears. As they complete, you can view either detailed or summary reports of an individual task or a single summary report that includes all migration jobs submitted during this session. To learn more, see [Using the SharePoint Migration Tool Reports](using-the-sharepoint-migration-tool-reports.md).
The SharePoint Migration Tool generates log files, summary and task level reports to help you manage, audit and troubleshoot your migration process.


## Monitor your migration

The **migration job** progress shows the overall progress of the migration job. Users can pause and resume all migration tasks, check the time elapsed and time remaining, and observe migration performance suggestions.

The **migration task** progress shows the progress of individual migration tasks. Users can pause/resume or delete a migration task, check the time elapsed and the time remaining, watch migration stats, and view reports.

## How to view the reports

These reports can be viewed while the migration is taking place or after the jobs are complete.
  
 **Viewing task level reports:**
  
1. After the migration has begun, select **View reports**.
    
2. A file folder opens listing the task level reports that have been generated for that specific task.
    
 **Viewing summary reports:**
  
1. After migration completes, select **Migration details**.
     
2. A folder with the summary reports opens.
    
## Summary Reports

Two types of summary reports are generated. The second type of summary report generated only if there are failures.
  
- **SummaryReport.csv.** This report contains a single row of data that gives the total picture total size, number of files migrated, duration. 
    
- **FailureSummary.csv.** This report is created only when failures or errors happen during the migration process. 
    
When assessing your migration jobs, we recommend that you first look at these summary reports. If a FailureSummary.csv file wasn't created, then no failures occurred during the task run.
  
### Summary Report

|Count of files |Total number of scanned items |
|Migrated bytes |The total number of bytes of data migrated. |
|Migrated GB in current round |The total size of the files migrated, expressed in gigabytes. |
|GB not migrated in current round |The total size of the files not migrated, expressed in gigabytes. |
|Total scanned items |Total number of files and list items, including those that is filtered out because of settings or potential scan issues. |

|Workflow ID |The ID number of the migration workflow. Many tasks can be in a single workflow. |
|Task ID |The individual task number. |
|Log Path |The location of the log files for each task. |
   
### Failure Summary Report

This report is only generated if a failure occurs during the job run.
  
|**Column**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Source |File path or URL of the location of the data being migrated. |
|Destination |The URL of the Site and library to where the data will be migrated. |

|Incremental round |The last incremental round number that item failed. |
|Task ID |The individual task number. |
|Device name |The name of the device or computer that is running the migration job. |
   
## Task Reports

When you need to do deeper investigation or a thorough verification of your migration task, the task level reports help you drill down into the specific details. The four recommended task level reports to use are:
  
- **ItemSummary.csv:** This is similar to the overall summary report except that it aggregates the data just for a single task. 
    
- **ItemFailureReport.csv:** This is the failure report at the item level. This is a filtered version of the files report, showing only failures. 
    
- **ItemReport.csv:**  A list of all the items this task attempted to do 
    
- **ScanSummary.csv:** This report gives statistical totals. 
    
- **StructureReport.csv:**  Structure report at the task level.
    
- **StructureFailureReport.csv:**  Structure failure report at the task level.
    
- **StructureFailureSummary.csv:**  This is an aggregate of all the structural task failure reports. This will only be generated if there are failures.

## Performance report

This report provides scores ranging from 1 to 100. The greater the number, the higher the speed. While these scores can't predict how fast the migration performs, they can help identify areas that could be impacting your migration performance.
