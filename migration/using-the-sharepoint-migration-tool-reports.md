# Using the SharePoint Migration Tool Reports


The SharePoint Migration Tool generates log files, summary and task level reports to help you manage, audit and troubleshoot your migration process.
  
## How to view the reports

These reports can be viewed while the migration is taking place or after the jobs are complete.
  
 **Viewing task level reports:**
  
1. After the migration has begun, click **View reports**.
    
2. A file folder will open listing the task level reports that have been generated for that specific task.
    
 **Viewing summary reports:**
  
1. After migration completes, click **Migration details**.
     
2. A folder with the summary reports opens.
    
## Summary Reports

Two types of summary reports are generated. The second type of summary report generated only if there is failures.
  
- **SummaryReport.csv.** This report contains a single row of data that gives the total picture total size, number of files migrated, duration. 
    
- **FailureSummary.csv.** This report is created only when failures or errors happen during the migration process. 
    
When assessing your migration jobs, we recommend that you first look at these summary reports. If a FailureSummary.csv file was not created, then no failures occurred during the job run.
  
### Summary Report

|**Column**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Source  <br/> |File path or URL of the location of the data being migrated.  <br/> |
|Destination  <br/> |The URL of the Site and library to where the data will be migrated.  <br/> |

|GB/hour  <br/> |How many GB per migrated per hour.  <br/> |
|Round number  <br/> |The round number is the incremental number of times the report has been generated based on the multiple passes the tool made to get all the content it could into the destination.  <br/> |

|Task ID  <br/> |The individual task number.  <br/> |
|Log Path  <br/> |The location of the log files for each task.  <br/> |
   
### Failure Summary Report

This report is only generated if a failure occurs during the job run.
  
|**Column**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Source  <br/> |File path or URL of the location of the data being migrated.  <br/> |
|Destination  <br/> |The URL of the Site and library to where the data will be migrated.  <br/> |
|File name  <br/> |Failed file or folder name or list items  <br/> |
|Extension  <br/> |If it is a folder, then the extension is empty, else if it is a file, then extension is file extension.  <br/> |

|Task ID  <br/> |The individual task number.  <br/> |
|Device name  <br/> |The name of the device or computer that is running the migration job.  <br/> |
   
## Task Reports

When you need to do deeper investigation or a thorough verification of your migration task, the task level reports help you drill down into the specific details. The four recommended task level reports to use are:
  
- **ItemSummary.csv:** This is similar to the overall summary report except that it aggregates the data just for a single task. 
    
- **ItemFailureReport.csv:** This is the failure report at the item level. This is a filtered version of the filese report, showing only failures. 
    
- **ItemReport.csv:**  A list of all the items this task attempted to do 
    
- **ScanSummary.csv:** This report gives statistical totals. 
    
- **StructureReport.csv:**  Structure report at the task level.
    
- **StructureFailureReport.csv:**  Structure failure report at the task level.
    
- **StructureFailureSummary.csv:**  This is an aggregate of all the structural task failure reports. This will only be generated if there are failures.

### Performance report

This report provides scores ranging from 1 to 100. The greater the number, the higher the speed. While these scores cannot predict how fast the migration will perform, they can help identify areas that could be impacting your migration performance.
