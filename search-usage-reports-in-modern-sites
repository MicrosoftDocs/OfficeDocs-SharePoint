If you're a SharePoint admin in your organization, you're probably asked questions about search usage, such as:

•	What are the top queries on my site per day or per month?
•	How many search queries are users performing on average?
•	Which queries are getting low clicks as they're simply not showing up in any results?
•	How often are query rules firing and how often are people clicking promoted results?

This article describes how you can use search reports in the SharePoint admin center to find answers to these questions.

# To view a report
To view search usage reports in modern sites, navigate to Site settings| Site collection administration| Microsoft Search | Configure search settings | Insights.

Modern site collection search usage reports with Microsoft Search provide a few graphs and tables generated from searches that are executed from search in modern sites. You can see data from the past 31 days (about 1 month), per day, or monthly for the previous year. 
 
The first date picker lets you pick past 31 days (about 1 month) or past 12 months for the first 2 graphs. The second date picker lets you select a particular day or month for the bottom 3 tables (top, abandoned, no results). Downloading a report will allow you to see reports from a broader range of time. Click on the download arrow and select past 31 days (about 1 month) or past 12 months. The report is downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet. If you selected the past 31 days (about 1 month), the spreadsheet will have an individual tab for each day. The past 12 months download will have a tab for each month.
